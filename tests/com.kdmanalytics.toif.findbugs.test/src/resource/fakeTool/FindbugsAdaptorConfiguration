#BC: Equals method should not assume anything about the type of its argument (BC_EQUALS_METHOD_SHOULD_WORK_FOR_ALL_OBJECTS)
BC_EQUALS_METHOD_SHOULD_WORK_FOR_ALL_OBJECTS=;SFP--1;CWE-398
BC_EQUALS_METHOD_SHOULD_WORK_FOR_ALL_OBJECTSMsg=The equals(Object o) method shouldn't make any assumptions about the type of o. It should simply return false if o is not the same type as this.

#BIT: Check for sign of bitwise operation (BIT_SIGNED_CHECK)
BIT_SIGNED_CHECK=;SFP--1;CWE-480
BIT_SIGNED_CHECKMsg=This method compares an expression such as ((event.detail & SWT.SELECTED) > 0). Using bit arithmetic and then comparing with the greater than operator can lead to unexpected results (of course depending on the value of SWT.SELECTED). If SWT.SELECTED is a negative number, this is a candidate for a bug. Even when SWT.SELECTED is not negative, it seems good practice to use '!= 0' instead of '> 0'.

#CN: Class implements Cloneable but does not define or use clone method (CN_IDIOM)
CN_IDIOM=;SFP--1;CWE-710
CN_IDIOMMsg=Class implements Cloneable but does not define or use the clone method.

#CN: clone method does not call super.clone() (CN_IDIOM_NO_SUPER_CALL)
CN_IDIOM_NO_SUPER_CALL=;SFP-28;CWE-580
CN_IDIOM_NO_SUPER_CALLMsg=This non-final class defines a clone() method that does not call super.clone(). If this class ("A") is extended by a subclass ("B"), and the subclass B calls super.clone(), then it is likely that B's clone() method will return an object of type A, which violates the standard contract for clone(). If all clone() methods call super.clone(), then they are guaranteed to use Object.clone(), which always returns an object of the correct type.

#CN: Class defines clone() but doesn't implement Cloneable (CN_IMPLEMENTS_CLONE_BUT_NOT_CLONEABLE)
CN_IMPLEMENTS_CLONE_BUT_NOT_CLONEABLE=;SFP--1;CWE-710
CN_IMPLEMENTS_CLONE_BUT_NOT_CLONEABLEMsg=This class defines a clone() method but the class doesn't implement Cloneable. There are some situations in which this is OK (e.g., you want to control how subclasses can clone themselves), but just make sure that this is what you intended.

#CNT: Rough value of known constant found (CNT_ROUGH_CONSTANT_VALUE)
CNT_ROUGH_CONSTANT_VALUE=;SFP--1;CWE-710
CNT_ROUGH_CONSTANT_VALUEMsg=It's recommended to use the predefined library constant for code clarity and better precision.

#Co: Abstract class defines covariant compareTo() method (CO_ABSTRACT_SELF)
CO_ABSTRACT_SELF=;SFP--1;CWE-710
CO_ABSTRACT_SELFMsg=This class defines a covariant version of compareTo().  To correctly override the compareTo() method in the Comparable interface, the parameter of compareTo() must have type java.lang.Object.

#Co: compareTo()/compare() incorrectly handles float or double value (CO_COMPARETO_INCORRECT_FLOATING)
CO_COMPARETO_INCORRECT_FLOATING=;SFP-1;CWE-697
CO_COMPARETO_INCORRECT_FLOATINGMsg=This method compares double or float values using pattern like this: val1 > val2 ? 1 : val1 < val2 ? -1 : 0. This pattern works incorrectly for -0.0 and NaN values which may result in incorrect sorting result or broken collection (if compared values are used as keys). Consider using Double.compare or Float.compare static methods which handle all the special cases correctly.

#Co: compareTo()/compare() returns Integer.MIN_VALUE (CO_COMPARETO_RESULTS_MIN_VALUE)
CO_COMPARETO_RESULTS_MIN_VALUE=;SFP-1;CWE-697
CO_COMPARETO_RESULTS_MIN_VALUEMsg=In some situation, this compareTo or compare method returns the constant Integer.MIN_VALUE, which is an exceptionally bad practice. The only thing that matters about the return value of compareTo is the sign of the result. But people will sometimes negate the return value of compareTo, expecting that this will negate the sign of the result. And it will, except in the case where the value returned is Integer.MIN_VALUE. So just return -1 rather than Integer.MIN_VALUE.

#Co: Covariant compareTo() method defined (CO_SELF_NO_OBJECT)
CO_SELF_NO_OBJECT=;SFP--1;CWE-710
CO_SELF_NO_OBJECTMsg=This class defines a covariant version of compareTo().  To correctly override the compareTo() method in the Comparable interface, the parameter of compareTo() must have type java.lang.Object.

#DE: Method might drop exception (DE_MIGHT_DROP)
DE_MIGHT_DROP=;SFP-4;CWE-390
DE_MIGHT_DROPMsg=This method might drop an exception.  In general, exceptions should be handled or reported in some way, or they should be thrown out of the method.

#DE: Method might ignore exception (DE_MIGHT_IGNORE)
DE_MIGHT_IGNORE=;SFP-4;CWE-390
DE_MIGHT_IGNOREMsg=This method might ignore an exception.  In general, exceptions should be handled or reported in some way, or they should be thrown out of the method.

#DMI: Adding elements of an entry set may fail due to reuse of Entry objects (DMI_ENTRY_SETS_MAY_REUSE_ENTRY_OBJECTS)
DMI_ENTRY_SETS_MAY_REUSE_ENTRY_OBJECTS=;SFP-3;CWE-440;
DMI_ENTRY_SETS_MAY_REUSE_ENTRY_OBJECTSMsg=The entrySet() method is allowed to return a view of the underlying Map in which a single Entry object is reused and returned during the iteration. As of Java 1.6, both IdentityHashMap and EnumMap did so. When iterating through such a Map, the Entry value is only valid until you advance to the next iteration. If, for example, you try to pass such an entrySet to an addAll method, things will go badly wrong.

#DMI: Random object created and used only once (DMI_RANDOM_USED_ONLY_ONCE)
DMI_RANDOM_USED_ONLY_ONCE=;SFP--1;CWE-330
DMI_RANDOM_USED_ONLY_ONCEMsg=This code creates a java.util.Random object, uses it to generate one random number, and then discards the Random object. This produces mediocre quality random numbers and is inefficient. If possible, rewrite the code so that the Random object is created once and saved, and each time a new random number is required invoke a method on the existing Random object to obtain it. If it is important that the generated Random numbers not be guessable, you must not create a new Random for each random number; the values are too easily guessable. You should strongly consider using a java.security.SecureRandom instead (and avoid allocating a new SecureRandom for each random number needed).

#DMI: Don't use removeAll to clear a collection (DMI_USING_REMOVEALL_TO_CLEAR_COLLECTION)
DMI_USING_REMOVEALL_TO_CLEAR_COLLECTION=;SFP-1;CWE-710
DMI_USING_REMOVEALL_TO_CLEAR_COLLECTIONMsg=If you want to remove all elements from a collection c, use c.clear, not c.removeAll(c). Calling c.removeAll(c) to clear a collection is less clear, susceptible to errors from typos, less efficient and for some collections, might throw a ConcurrentModificationException.

#Dm: Method invokes System.exit(...) (DM_EXIT)
DM_EXIT=;SFP--1;CWE-710
DM_EXITMsg=Invoking System.exit shuts down the entire Java virtual machine. This should only been done when it is appropriate. Such calls make it hard or impossible for your code to be invoked by other code. Consider throwing a RuntimeException instead.

#Dm: Method invokes dangerous method runFinalizersOnExit (DM_RUN_FINALIZERS_ON_EXIT)
DM_RUN_FINALIZERS_ON_EXIT=;SFP-3;CWE-242
DM_RUN_FINALIZERS_ON_EXITMsg=Never call System.runFinalizersOnExit or Runtime.runFinalizersOnExit for any reason: they are among the most dangerous methods in the Java libraries. -- Joshua Bloch

#ES: Comparison of String parameter using == or != (ES_COMPARING_PARAMETER_STRING_WITH_EQ)
ES_COMPARING_PARAMETER_STRING_WITH_EQ=;SFP-1;CWE-597
ES_COMPARING_PARAMETER_STRING_WITH_EQMsg=This code compares a java.lang.String parameter for reference equality using the == or != operators. Requiring callers to pass only String constants or interned strings to a method is unnecessarily fragile, and rarely leads to measurable performance gains. Consider using the equals(Object) method instead.

#ES: Comparison of String objects using == or != (ES_COMPARING_STRINGS_WITH_EQ)
ES_COMPARING_STRINGS_WITH_EQ=;SFP-1;CWE-597
ES_COMPARING_STRINGS_WITH_EQMsg=This code compares java.lang.String objects for reference equality using the == or != operators. Unless both strings are either constants in a source file, or have been interned using the String.intern() method, the same string value may be represented by two different String objects. Consider using the equals(Object) method instead.

#Eq: Abstract class defines covariant equals() method (EQ_ABSTRACT_SELF)
EQ_ABSTRACT_SELF=;SFP--1;CWE-710
EQ_ABSTRACT_SELFMsg=This class defines a covariant version of equals().  To correctly override the equals() method in java.lang.Object, the parameter of equals() must have type java.lang.Object.

#Eq: Equals checks for incompatible operand (EQ_CHECK_FOR_OPERAND_NOT_COMPATIBLE_WITH_THIS)
EQ_CHECK_FOR_OPERAND_NOT_COMPATIBLE_WITH_THIS=;SFP--1;CWE-710
EQ_CHECK_FOR_OPERAND_NOT_COMPATIBLE_WITH_THISMsg=This equals method is checking to see if the argument is some incompatible type (i.e., a class that is neither a supertype nor subtype of the class that defines the equals method).

#Eq: Class defines compareTo(...) and uses Object.equals() (EQ_COMPARETO_USE_OBJECT_EQUALS)
EQ_COMPARETO_USE_OBJECT_EQUALS=;SFP--1;CWE-710
EQ_COMPARETO_USE_OBJECT_EQUALSMsg=This class defines a compareTo(...) method but inherits its equals() method from java.lang.Object. Generally, the value of compareTo should return zero if and only if equals returns true. If this is violated, weird and unpredictable failures will occur in classes such as PriorityQueue. In Java 5 the PriorityQueue.remove method uses the compareTo method, while in Java 6 it uses the equals method.

#Eq: equals method fails for subtypes (EQ_GETCLASS_AND_CLASS_CONSTANT)
EQ_GETCLASS_AND_CLASS_CONSTANT=;SFP--1;CWE-710
EQ_GETCLASS_AND_CLASS_CONSTANTMsg=This class has an equals method that will be broken if it is inherited by subclasses. It compares a class literal with the class of the argument (e.g., in class Foo it might check if Foo.class == o.getClass()). It is better to check if this.getClass() == o.getClass().

#Eq: Covariant equals() method defined (EQ_SELF_NO_OBJECT)
EQ_SELF_NO_OBJECT=;SFP--1;CWE-710
EQ_SELF_NO_OBJECTMsg=This class defines a covariant version of equals().  To correctly override the equals() method in java.lang.Object, the parameter of equals() must have type java.lang.Object.

#FI: Empty finalizer should be deleted (FI_EMPTY)
FI_EMPTY=;SFP--1;CWE-710
FI_EMPTYMsg=Empty finalize() methods are useless, so they should be deleted.

#FI: Explicit invocation of finalizer (FI_EXPLICIT_INVOCATION)
FI_EXPLICIT_INVOCATION=;SFP-3;CWE-586
FI_EXPLICIT_INVOCATIONMsg=This method contains an explicit invocation of the finalize() method on an object.  Because finalizer methods are supposed to be executed once, and only by the VM, this is a bad idea. If a connected set of objects beings finalizable, then the VM will invoke the finalize method on all the finalizable object, possibly at the same time in different threads. Thus, it is a particularly bad idea, in the finalize method for a class X, invoke finalize on objects referenced by X, because they may already be getting finalized in a separate thread.

#FI: Finalizer nulls fields (FI_FINALIZER_NULLS_FIELDS)
FI_FINALIZER_NULLS_FIELDS=;SFP--1;CWE-710
FI_FINALIZER_NULLS_FIELDSMsg=This finalizer nulls out fields. This is usually an error, as it does not aid garbage collection, and the object is going to be garbage collected anyway.

#FI: Finalizer only nulls fields (FI_FINALIZER_ONLY_NULLS_FIELDS)
FI_FINALIZER_ONLY_NULLS_FIELDS=;SFP--1;CWE-710
FI_FINALIZER_ONLY_NULLS_FIELDSMsg=This finalizer does nothing except null out fields. This is completely pointless, and requires that the object be garbage collected, finalized, and then garbage collected again. You should just remove the finalize method.

#FI: Finalizer does not call superclass finalizer (FI_MISSING_SUPER_CALL)
FI_MISSING_SUPER_CALL=;SFP-28;CWE-586
FI_MISSING_SUPER_CALLMsg=This finalize() method does not make a call to its superclass's finalize() method.  So, any finalizer actions defined for the superclass will not be performed.  Add a call to super.finalize().

#FI: Finalizer nullifies superclass finalizer (FI_NULLIFY_SUPER)
FI_NULLIFY_SUPER=;SFP--1;CWE-710
FI_NULLIFY_SUPERMsg=This empty finalize() method explicitly negates the effect of any finalizer defined by its superclass.  Any finalizer actions defined for the superclass will not be performed.  Unless this is intended, delete this method.

#FI: Finalizer does nothing but call superclass finalizer (FI_USELESS)
FI_USELESS=;SFP--1;CWE-710
FI_USELESSMsg=The only thing this finalize() method does is call the superclass's finalize() method, making it redundant.  Delete it.

#FS: Format string should use %n rather than n (VA_FORMAT_STRING_USES_NEWLINE)
VA_FORMAT_STRING_USES_NEWLINE=;SFP--1;CWE-133
VA_FORMAT_STRING_USES_NEWLINEMsg=This format string include a newline character (\n). In format strings, it is generally preferable better to use %n, which will produce the platform-specific line separator.

#GC: Unchecked type in generic call (GC_UNCHECKED_TYPE_IN_GENERIC_CALL)
GC_UNCHECKED_TYPE_IN_GENERIC_CALL=;SFP--1;CWE-710
GC_UNCHECKED_TYPE_IN_GENERIC_CALLMsg=This call to a generic collection method passes an argument while compile type Object where a specific type from the generic type parameters is expected. Thus, neither the standard Java type system nor static analysis can provide useful information on whether the object being passed as a parameter is of an appropriate type.

#HE: Class defines equals() but not hashCode() (HE_EQUALS_NO_HASHCODE)
HE_EQUALS_NO_HASHCODE=;SFP--1;CWE-581
HE_EQUALS_NO_HASHCODEMsg=This class overrides equals(Object), but does not override hashCode().  Therefore, the class may violate the invariant that equal objects must have equal hashcodes.

#HE: Class defines equals() and uses Object.hashCode() (HE_EQUALS_USE_HASHCODE)
HE_EQUALS_USE_HASHCODE=;SFP--1;CWE-581
HE_EQUALS_USE_HASHCODEMsg=This class overrides equals(Object), but does not override hashCode(), and inherits the implementation of hashCode() from java.lang.Object (which returns the identity hash code, an arbitrary value assigned to the object by the VM).  Therefore, the class is very likely to violate the invariant that equal objects must have equal hashcodes.

#HE: Class defines hashCode() but not equals() (HE_HASHCODE_NO_EQUALS)
HE_HASHCODE_NO_EQUALS=;SFP--1;CWE-581
HE_HASHCODE_NO_EQUALSMsg=This class defines a hashCode() method but not an equals() method.  Therefore, the class may violate the invariant that equal objects must have equal hashcodes.

#HE: Class defines hashCode() and uses Object.equals() (HE_HASHCODE_USE_OBJECT_EQUALS)
HE_HASHCODE_USE_OBJECT_EQUALS=;SFP--1;CWE-581
HE_HASHCODE_USE_OBJECT_EQUALSMsg=This class defines a hashCode() method but inherits its equals() method from java.lang.Object (which defines equality by comparing object references).  Although this will probably satisfy the contract that equal objects must have equal hashcodes, it is probably not what was intended by overriding the hashCode() method.  (Overriding hashCode() implies that the object's identity is based on criteria more complicated than simple reference equality.)

#HE: Class inherits equals() and uses Object.hashCode() (HE_INHERITS_EQUALS_USE_HASHCODE)
HE_INHERITS_EQUALS_USE_HASHCODE=;SFP--1;CWE-581
HE_INHERITS_EQUALS_USE_HASHCODEMsg=This class inherits equals(Object) from an abstract superclass, and hashCode() from java.lang.Object (which returns the identity hash code, an arbitrary value assigned to the object by the VM).  Therefore, the class is very likely to violate the invariant that equal objects must have equal hashcodes.

#IC: Superclass uses subclass during initialization (IC_SUPERCLASS_USES_SUBCLASS_DURING_INITIALIZATION)
IC_SUPERCLASS_USES_SUBCLASS_DURING_INITIALIZATION=;SFP--1;CWE-710
IC_SUPERCLASS_USES_SUBCLASS_DURING_INITIALIZATIONMsg=During the initialization of a class, the class makes an active use of a subclass. That subclass will not yet be initialized at the time of this use.

#IMSE: Dubious catching of IllegalMonitorStateException (IMSE_DONT_CATCH_IMSE)
IMSE_DONT_CATCH_IMSE=;SFP--1;CWE-398
IMSE_DONT_CATCH_IMSEMsg=IllegalMonitorStateException is generally only thrown in case of a design flaw in your code (calling wait or notify on an object you do not hold a lock on).

#ISC: Needless instantiation of class that only supplies static methods (ISC_INSTANTIATE_STATIC_CLASS)
ISC_INSTANTIATE_STATIC_CLASS=;SFP--1;CWE-710
ISC_INSTANTIATE_STATIC_CLASSMsg=This class allocates an object that is based on a class that only supplies static methods. This object does not need to be created, just access the static methods directly using the class name as a qualifier.

#It: Iterator next() method can't throw NoSuchElementException (IT_NO_SUCH_ELEMENT)
IT_NO_SUCH_ELEMENT=;SFP--1;CWE-710
IT_NO_SUCH_ELEMENTMsg=This class implements the java.util.Iterator interface.  However, its next() method is not capable of throwing java.util.NoSuchElementException.  The next() method should be changed so it throws NoSuchElementException if is called when there are no more elements to return.

#JCIP: Fields of immutable classes should be final (JCIP_FIELD_ISNT_FINAL_IN_IMMUTABLE_CLASS)
JCIP_FIELD_ISNT_FINAL_IN_IMMUTABLE_CLASS=;SFP--1;CWE-710
JCIP_FIELD_ISNT_FINAL_IN_IMMUTABLE_CLASSMsg=The class is annotated with net.jcip.annotations.Immutable, and the rules for that annotation require that all fields are final. .

#ME: Public enum method unconditionally sets its field (ME_ENUM_FIELD_SETTER)
ME_ENUM_FIELD_SETTER=;SFP-27;CWE-471
ME_ENUM_FIELD_SETTERMsg=This public method declared in public enum unconditionally sets enum field, thus this field can be changed by malicious code or by accident from another package. Though mutable enum fields may be used for lazy initialization, it's a bad practice to expose them to the outer world. Consider removing this method or declaring it package-private.

#ME: Enum field is public and mutable (ME_MUTABLE_ENUM_FIELD)
ME_MUTABLE_ENUM_FIELD=;SFP-27;CWE-471
ME_MUTABLE_ENUM_FIELDMsg=A mutable public field is defined inside a public enum, thus can be changed by malicious code or by accident from another package. Though mutable enum fields may be used for lazy initialization, it's a bad practice to expose them to the outer world. Consider declaring this field final and/or package-private.

#NP: Method with Boolean return type returns explicit null (NP_BOOLEAN_RETURN_NULL)
NP_BOOLEAN_RETURN_NULL=;SFP-4;CWE-394
NP_BOOLEAN_RETURN_NULLMsg=A method that returns either Boolean.TRUE, Boolean.FALSE or null is an accident waiting to happen. This method can be invoked as though it returned a value of type boolean, and the compiler will insert automatic unboxing of the Boolean value. If a null value is returned, this will result in a NullPointerException.

#NP: Clone method may return null (NP_CLONE_COULD_RETURN_NULL)
NP_CLONE_COULD_RETURN_NULL=;SFP-4;CWE-394
NP_CLONE_COULD_RETURN_NULLMsg=This clone method seems to return null in some circumstances, but clone is never allowed to return a null value. If you are convinced this path is unreachable, throw an AssertionError instead.

#NP: equals() method does not check for null argument (NP_EQUALS_SHOULD_HANDLE_NULL_ARGUMENT)
NP_EQUALS_SHOULD_HANDLE_NULL_ARGUMENT=API;SFP--1;CWE-227
NP_EQUALS_SHOULD_HANDLE_NULL_ARGUMENTMsg=This implementation of equals(Object) violates the contract defined by java.lang.Object.equals() because it does not check for null being passed as the argument. All equals() methods should return false if passed a null value.

#NP: toString method may return null (NP_TOSTRING_COULD_RETURN_NULL)
NP_TOSTRING_COULD_RETURN_NULL=API;SFP--1;CWE-227
NP_TOSTRING_COULD_RETURN_NULLMsg=This toString method seems to return null in some circumstances. A liberal reading of the spec could be interpreted as allowing this, but it is probably a bad idea and could cause other code to break. Return the empty string or some other appropriate string rather than null.

#Nm: Class names should start with an upper case letter (NM_CLASS_NAMING_CONVENTION)
NM_CLASS_NAMING_CONVENTION=;SFP--1;CWE-710
NM_CLASS_NAMING_CONVENTIONMsg=Class names should be nouns, in mixed case with the first letter of each internal word capitalized. Try to keep your class names simple and descriptive. Use whole words-avoid acronyms and abbreviations (unless the abbreviation is much more widely used than the long form, such as URL or HTML).

#Nm: Class is not derived from an Exception, even though it is named as such (NM_CLASS_NOT_EXCEPTION)
NM_CLASS_NOT_EXCEPTION=;SFP--1;CWE-710
NM_CLASS_NOT_EXCEPTIONMsg=This class is not derived from another exception, but ends with 'Exception'. This will be confusing to users of this class.

#Nm: Confusing method names (NM_CONFUSING)
NM_CONFUSING=;SFP--1;CWE-710
NM_CONFUSINGMsg=The referenced methods have names that differ only by capitalization.

#Nm: Field names should start with a lower case letter (NM_FIELD_NAMING_CONVENTION)
NM_FIELD_NAMING_CONVENTION=;SFP--1;CWE-710
NM_FIELD_NAMING_CONVENTIONMsg=Names of fields that are not final should be in mixed case with a lowercase first letter and the first letters of subsequent words capitalized.

#Nm: Use of identifier that is a keyword in later versions of Java (NM_FUTURE_KEYWORD_USED_AS_IDENTIFIER)
NM_FUTURE_KEYWORD_USED_AS_IDENTIFIER=;SFP--1;CWE-710
NM_FUTURE_KEYWORD_USED_AS_IDENTIFIERMsg=The identifier is a word that is reserved as a keyword in later versions of Java, and your code will need to be changed in order to compile it in later versions of Java.

#Nm: Use of identifier that is a keyword in later versions of Java (NM_FUTURE_KEYWORD_USED_AS_MEMBER_IDENTIFIER)
NM_FUTURE_KEYWORD_USED_AS_MEMBER_IDENTIFIER=;SFP--1;CWE-710
NM_FUTURE_KEYWORD_USED_AS_MEMBER_IDENTIFIERMsg=This identifier is used as a keyword in later versions of Java. This code, and any code that references this API, will need to be changed in order to compile it in later versions of Java.

#Nm: Method names should start with a lower case letter (NM_METHOD_NAMING_CONVENTION)
NM_METHOD_NAMING_CONVENTION=;SFP--1;CWE-710
NM_METHOD_NAMING_CONVENTIONMsg=Methods should be verbs, in mixed case with the first letter lowercase, with the first letter of each internal word capitalized.

#Nm: Class names shouldn't shadow simple name of implemented interface (NM_SAME_SIMPLE_NAME_AS_INTERFACE)
NM_SAME_SIMPLE_NAME_AS_INTERFACE=;SFP--1;CWE-710
NM_SAME_SIMPLE_NAME_AS_INTERFACEMsg=This class/interface has a simple name that is identical to that of an implemented/extended interface, except that the interface is in a different package (e.g., alpha.Foo extends beta.Foo). This can be exceptionally confusing, create lots of situations in which you have to look at import statements to resolve references and creates many opportunities to accidently define methods that do not override methods in their superclasses.

#Nm: Class names shouldn't shadow simple name of superclass (NM_SAME_SIMPLE_NAME_AS_SUPERCLASS)
NM_SAME_SIMPLE_NAME_AS_SUPERCLASS=;SFP--1;CWE-710
NM_SAME_SIMPLE_NAME_AS_SUPERCLASSMsg=This class has a simple name that is identical to that of its superclass, except that its superclass is in a different package (e.g., alpha.Foo extends beta.Foo). This can be exceptionally confusing, create lots of situations in which you have to look at import statements to resolve references and creates many opportunities to accidently define methods that do not override methods in their superclasses.

#Nm: Very confusing method names (but perhaps intentional) (NM_VERY_CONFUSING_INTENTIONAL)
NM_VERY_CONFUSING_INTENTIONAL=;SFP--1;CWE-710
NM_VERY_CONFUSING_INTENTIONALMsg=The referenced methods have names that differ only by capitalization. This is very confusing because if the capitalization were identical then one of the methods would override the other. From the existence of other methods, it seems that the existence of both of these methods is intentional, but is sure is confusing. You should try hard to eliminate one of them, unless you are forced to have both due to frozen APIs.

#Nm: Method doesn't override method in superclass due to wrong package for parameter (NM_WRONG_PACKAGE_INTENTIONAL)
NM_WRONG_PACKAGE_INTENTIONAL=;SFP--1;CWE-710
NM_WRONG_PACKAGE_INTENTIONALMsg=The method in the subclass doesn't override a similar method in a superclass because the type of a parameter doesn't exactly match the type of the corresponding parameter in the superclass.

#ODR: Method may fail to close database resource (ODR_OPEN_DATABASE_RESOURCE)
ODR_OPEN_DATABASE_RESOURCE=;SFP-14;CWE-772
ODR_OPEN_DATABASE_RESOURCEMsg=The method creates a database resource (such as a database connection or row set), does not assign it to any fields, pass it to other methods, or return it, and does not appear to close the object on all paths out of the method.  Failure to close database resources on all paths out of a method may result in poor performance, and could cause the application to have problems communicating with the database.

#ODR: Method may fail to close database resource on exception (ODR_OPEN_DATABASE_RESOURCE_EXCEPTION_PATH)
ODR_OPEN_DATABASE_RESOURCE_EXCEPTION_PATH=;SFP-14;CWE-772
ODR_OPEN_DATABASE_RESOURCE_EXCEPTION_PATHMsg=The method creates a database resource (such as a database connection or row set), does not assign it to any fields, pass it to other methods, or return it, and does not appear to close the object on all exception paths out of the method.  Failure to close database resources on all paths out of a method may result in poor performance, and could cause the application to have problems communicating with the database.

#OS: Method may fail to close stream (OS_OPEN_STREAM)
OS_OPEN_STREAM=;SFP-14;CWE-772
OS_OPEN_STREAMMsg=The method creates an IO stream object, does not assign it to any fields, pass it to other methods that might close it, or return it, and does not appear to close the stream on all paths out of the method.  This may result in a file descriptor leak.  It is generally a good idea to use a finally block to ensure that streams are closed.

#OS: Method may fail to close stream on exception (OS_OPEN_STREAM_EXCEPTION_PATH)
OS_OPEN_STREAM_EXCEPTION_PATH=;SFP-14;CWE-772
OS_OPEN_STREAM_EXCEPTION_PATHMsg=The method creates an IO stream object, does not assign it to any fields, pass it to other methods, or return it, and does not appear to close it on all possible exception paths out of the method.  This may result in a file descriptor leak.  It is generally a good idea to use a finally block to ensure that streams are closed.

#PZ: Don't reuse entry objects in iterators (PZ_DONT_REUSE_ENTRY_OBJECTS_IN_ITERATORS)
PZ_DONT_REUSE_ENTRY_OBJECTS_IN_ITERATORS=;SFP-23;CWE-374
PZ_DONT_REUSE_ENTRY_OBJECTS_IN_ITERATORSMsg=The entrySet() method is allowed to return a view of the underlying Map in which an Iterator and Map.Entry. This clever idea was used in several Map implementations, but introduces the possibility of nasty coding mistakes. If a map m returns such an iterator for an entrySet, then c.addAll(m.entrySet()) will go badly wrong. All of the Map implementations in OpenJDK 1.7 have been rewritten to avoid this, you should to.

#RC: Suspicious reference comparison to constant (RC_REF_COMPARISON_BAD_PRACTICE)
RC_REF_COMPARISON_BAD_PRACTICE=;SFP--1;CWE-480
RC_REF_COMPARISON_BAD_PRACTICEMsg=This method compares a reference value to a constant using the == or != operator, where the correct way to compare instances of this type is generally with the equals() method. It is possible to create distinct instances that are equal but do not compare as == since they are different objects. Examples of classes which should generally not be compared by reference are java.lang.Integer, java.lang.Float, etc.

#RC: Suspicious reference comparison of Boolean values (RC_REF_COMPARISON_BAD_PRACTICE_BOOLEAN)
RC_REF_COMPARISON_BAD_PRACTICE_BOOLEAN=;SFP--1;CWE-480
RC_REF_COMPARISON_BAD_PRACTICE_BOOLEANMsg=This method compares two Boolean values using the == or != operator. Normally, there are only two Boolean values (Boolean.TRUE and Boolean.FALSE), but it is possible to create other Boolean objects using the new Boolean(b) constructor. It is best to avoid such objects, but if they do exist, then checking Boolean objects for equality using == or != will give results than are different than you would get using .equals(...)

#RR: Method ignores results of InputStream.read() (RR_NOT_CHECKED)
RR_NOT_CHECKED=;SFP-4;CWE-252
RR_NOT_CHECKEDMsg=This method ignores the return value of one of the variants of java.io.InputStream.read() which can return multiple bytes.  If the return value is not checked, the caller will not be able to correctly handle the case where fewer bytes were read than the caller requested.  This is a particularly insidious kind of bug, because in many programs, reads from input streams usually do read the full amount of data requested, causing the program to fail only sporadically.

#RR: Method ignores results of InputStream.skip() (SR_NOT_CHECKED)
SR_NOT_CHECKED=;SFP-4;CWE-252
SR_NOT_CHECKEDMsg=This method ignores the return value of java.io.InputStream.skip() which can skip multiple bytes.  If the return value is not checked, the caller will not be able to correctly handle the case where fewer bytes were skipped than the caller requested.  This is a particularly insidious kind of bug, because in many programs, skips from input streams usually do skip the full amount of data requested, causing the program to fail only sporadically. With Buffered streams, however, skip() will only skip data in the buffer, and will routinely fail to skip the requested number of bytes.

#RV: Negating the result of compareTo()/compare() (RV_NEGATING_RESULT_OF_COMPARETO)
RV_NEGATING_RESULT_OF_COMPARETO=;SFP-1;CWE-191
RV_NEGATING_RESULT_OF_COMPARETOMsg=This code negatives the return value of a compareTo or compare method. This is a questionable or bad programming practice, since if the return value is Integer.MIN_VALUE, negating the return value won't negate the sign of the result. You can achieve the same intended result by reversing the order of the operands rather than by negating the results.

#RV: Method ignores exceptional return value (RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE)
RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICE=;SFP-4;CWE-252
RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_BAD_PRACTICEMsg=This method returns a value that is not checked. The return value should be checked since it can indicate an unusual or unexpected function execution. For example, the File.delete() method returns false if the file could not be successfully deleted (rather than throwing an Exception). If you don't check the result, you won't notice if the method invocation signals unexpected behavior by returning an atypical return value.

#SI: Static initializer creates instance before all static final fields assigned (SI_INSTANCE_BEFORE_FINALS_ASSIGNED)
SI_INSTANCE_BEFORE_FINALS_ASSIGNED=;SFP-1;CWE-456
SI_INSTANCE_BEFORE_FINALS_ASSIGNEDMsg=The class's static initializer creates an instance of the class before all of the static final fields are assigned.

#SW: Certain swing methods needs to be invoked in Swing thread (SW_SWING_METHODS_INVOKED_IN_SWING_THREAD)
SW_SWING_METHODS_INVOKED_IN_SWING_THREAD=API;SFP--1;CWE-684
SW_SWING_METHODS_INVOKED_IN_SWING_THREADMsg=The Swing methods show(), setVisible(), and pack() will create the associated peer for the frame. With the creation of the peer, the system creates the event dispatch thread. This makes things problematic because the event dispatch thread could be notifying listeners while pack and validate are still processing. This situation could result in two threads going through the Swing component-based GUI -- it's a serious flaw that could result in deadlocks or other related threading issues. A pack call causes components to be realized. As they are being realized (that is, not necessarily visible), they could trigger listener notification on the event dispatch thread.

#Se: Non-transient non-serializable instance field in serializable class (SE_BAD_FIELD)
SE_BAD_FIELD=API;SFP--1;CWE-684
SE_BAD_FIELDMsg=This Serializable class defines a non-primitive instance field which is neither transient, Serializable, or java.lang.Object, and does not appear to implement the Externalizable interface or the readObject() and writeObject() methods.  Objects of this class will not be deserialized correctly if a non-Serializable object is stored in this field.

#Se: Non-serializable class has a serializable inner class (SE_BAD_FIELD_INNER_CLASS)
SE_BAD_FIELD_INNER_CLASS=API;SFP--1;CWE-684
SE_BAD_FIELD_INNER_CLASSMsg=This Serializable class is an inner class of a non-serializable class. Thus, attempts to serialize it will also attempt to associate instance of the outer class with which it is associated, leading to a runtime error. If possible, making the inner class a static inner class should solve the problem. Making the outer class serializable might also work, but that would mean serializing an instance of the inner class would always also serialize the instance of the outer class, which it often not what you really want.

#Se: Non-serializable value stored into instance field of a serializable class (SE_BAD_FIELD_STORE)
SE_BAD_FIELD_STORE=API;SFP--1;CWE-684
SE_BAD_FIELD_STOREMsg=A non-serializable value is stored into a non-transient field of a serializable class.

#Se: Comparator doesn't implement Serializable (SE_COMPARATOR_SHOULD_BE_SERIALIZABLE)
SE_COMPARATOR_SHOULD_BE_SERIALIZABLE=;SFP--1;CWE-710
SE_COMPARATOR_SHOULD_BE_SERIALIZABLEMsg=This class implements the Comparator interface. You should consider whether or not it should also implement the Serializable interface. If a comparator is used to construct an ordered collection such as a TreeMap, then the TreeMap will be serializable only if the comparator is also serializable. As most comparators have little or no state, making them serializable is generally easy and good defensive programming.

#Se: Serializable inner class (SE_INNER_CLASS)
SE_INNER_CLASS=API;SFP--1;CWE-684
SE_INNER_CLASSMsg=This Serializable class is an inner class. Any attempt to serialize it will also serialize the associated outer instance. The outer instance is serializable, so this won't fail, but it might serialize a lot more data than intended. If possible, making the inner class a static inner class (also known as a nested class) should solve the problem.

#Se: serialVersionUID isn't final (SE_NONFINAL_SERIALVERSIONID)
SE_NONFINAL_SERIALVERSIONID=;SFP--1;CWE-710
SE_NONFINAL_SERIALVERSIONIDMsg=This class defines a serialVersionUID field that is not final.  The field should be made final if it is intended to specify the version UID for purposes of serialization.

#Se: serialVersionUID isn't long (SE_NONLONG_SERIALVERSIONID)
SE_NONLONG_SERIALVERSIONID=;SFP--1;CWE-710
SE_NONLONG_SERIALVERSIONIDMsg=This class defines a serialVersionUID field that is not long.  The field should be made long if it is intended to specify the version UID for purposes of serialization.

#Se: serialVersionUID isn't static (SE_NONSTATIC_SERIALVERSIONID)
SE_NONSTATIC_SERIALVERSIONID=;SFP--1;CWE-710
SE_NONSTATIC_SERIALVERSIONIDMsg=This class defines a serialVersionUID field that is not static.  The field should be made static if it is intended to specify the version UID for purposes of serialization.

#Se: Class is Serializable but its superclass doesn't define a void constructor (SE_NO_SUITABLE_CONSTRUCTOR)
SE_NO_SUITABLE_CONSTRUCTOR=API;SFP--1;CWE-684
SE_NO_SUITABLE_CONSTRUCTORMsg=This class implements the Serializable interface and its superclass does not. When such an object is deserialized, the fields of the superclass need to be initialized by invoking the void constructor of the superclass. Since the superclass does not have one, serialization and deserialization will fail at runtime.

#Se: Class is Externalizable but doesn't define a void constructor (SE_NO_SUITABLE_CONSTRUCTOR_FOR_EXTERNALIZATION)
SE_NO_SUITABLE_CONSTRUCTOR_FOR_EXTERNALIZATION=API;SFP--1;CWE-684
SE_NO_SUITABLE_CONSTRUCTOR_FOR_EXTERNALIZATIONMsg=This class implements the Externalizable interface, but does not define a void constructor. When Externalizable objects are deserialized, they first need to be constructed by invoking the void constructor. Since this class does not have one, serialization and deserialization will fail at runtime.

#Se: The readResolve method must be declared with a return type of Object. (SE_READ_RESOLVE_MUST_RETURN_OBJECT)
SE_READ_RESOLVE_MUST_RETURN_OBJECT=API;SFP--1;CWE-684
SE_READ_RESOLVE_MUST_RETURN_OBJECTMsg=In order for the readResolve method to be recognized by the serialization mechanism, it must be declared to have a return type of Object.

#Se: Transient field that isn't set by deserialization. (SE_TRANSIENT_FIELD_NOT_RESTORED)
SE_TRANSIENT_FIELD_NOT_RESTORED=API;SFP--1;CWE-684
SE_TRANSIENT_FIELD_NOT_RESTOREDMsg=This class contains a field that is updated at multiple places in the class, thus it seems to be part of the state of the class. However, since the field is marked as transient and not set in readObject or readResolve, it will contain the default value in any deserialized instance of the class.

#SnVI: Class is Serializable, but doesn't define serialVersionUID (SE_NO_SERIALVERSIONID)
SE_NO_SERIALVERSIONID=API;SFP--1;CWE-684
SE_NO_SERIALVERSIONIDMsg=This class implements the Serializable interface, but does not define a serialVersionUID field.  A change as simple as adding a reference to a .class object will add synthetic fields to the class, which will unfortunately change the implicit serialVersionUID (e.g., adding a reference to String.class will generate a static field class$java$lang$String). Also, different source code to bytecode compilers may use different naming conventions for synthetic variables generated for references to class objects or inner classes. To ensure interoperability of Serializable across versions, consider adding an explicit serialVersionUID.

#UI: Usage of GetResource may be unsafe if class is extended (UI_INHERITANCE_UNSAFE_GETRESOURCE)
UI_INHERITANCE_UNSAFE_GETRESOURCE=;SFP-3;CWE-676
UI_INHERITANCE_UNSAFE_GETRESOURCEMsg=Calling this.getClass().getResource(...) could give results other than expected if this class is extended by a class in another package.

#BC: Impossible cast (BC_IMPOSSIBLE_CAST)
BC_IMPOSSIBLE_CAST=;SFP-1;CWE-704
BC_IMPOSSIBLE_CASTMsg=This cast will always throw a ClassCastException. FindBugs tracks type information from instanceof checks, and also uses more precise information about the types of values returned from methods and loaded from fields. Thus, it may have more precise information that just the declared type of a variable, and can use this to determine that a cast will always throw an exception at runtime.

#BC: Impossible downcast (BC_IMPOSSIBLE_DOWNCAST)
BC_IMPOSSIBLE_DOWNCAST=;SFP-1;CWE-704
BC_IMPOSSIBLE_DOWNCASTMsg=This cast will always throw a ClassCastException. The analysis believes it knows the precise type of the value being cast, and the attempt to downcast it to a subtype will always fail by throwing a ClassCastException.

#BC: Impossible downcast of toArray() result (BC_IMPOSSIBLE_DOWNCAST_OF_TOARRAY)
BC_IMPOSSIBLE_DOWNCAST_OF_TOARRAY=;SFP-1;CWE-704
BC_IMPOSSIBLE_DOWNCAST_OF_TOARRAYMsg=This code is casting the result of calling toArray() on a collection to a type more specific than Object[]

#BC: instanceof will always return false (BC_IMPOSSIBLE_INSTANCEOF)
BC_IMPOSSIBLE_INSTANCEOF=;SFP-1;CWE-570
BC_IMPOSSIBLE_INSTANCEOFMsg=This instanceof test will always return false. Although this is safe, make sure it isn't an indication of some misunderstanding or some other logic error.

#BIT: Bitwise add of signed byte value (BIT_ADD_OF_SIGNED_BYTE)
BIT_ADD_OF_SIGNED_BYTE=;SFP-1;CWE-194
BIT_ADD_OF_SIGNED_BYTEMsg=Adds a byte value and a value which is known to the 8 lower bits clear. Values loaded from a byte array are sign extended to 32 bits before any any bitwise operations are performed on the value. Thus, if b[0] contains the value 0xff, and x is initially 0, then the code ((x << 8) + b[0]) will sign extend 0xff to get 0xffffffff, and thus give the value 0xffffffff as the result.

#BIT: Incompatible bit masks (BIT_AND)
BIT_AND=;SFP-1;CWE-570
BIT_ANDMsg=This method compares an expression of the form (e & C) to D, which will always compare unequal due to the specific values of constants C and D. This may indicate a logic error or typo.

#BIT: Check to see if ((...) & 0) == 0 (BIT_AND_ZZ)
BIT_AND_ZZ=;SFP-1;CWE-571
BIT_AND_ZZMsg=This method compares an expression of the form (e & 0) to 0, which will always compare equal. This may indicate a logic error or typo.

#BIT: Incompatible bit masks (BIT_IOR)
BIT_IOR=;SFP-1;CWE-570
BIT_IORMsg=This method compares an expression of the form (e | C) to D. which will always compare unequal due to the specific values of constants C and D. This may indicate a logic error or typo. Typically, this bug occurs because the code wants to perform a membership test in a bit set, but uses the bitwise OR operator ("|") instead of bitwise AND ("&").

#BIT: Bitwise OR of signed byte value (BIT_IOR_OF_SIGNED_BYTE)
BIT_IOR_OF_SIGNED_BYTE=;SFP-1;CWE-194
BIT_IOR_OF_SIGNED_BYTEMsg=Loads a value from a byte array and performs a bitwise OR with that value. Values loaded from a byte array are sign extended to 32 bits before any any bitwise operations are performed on the value. Thus, if b[0] contains the value 0xff, and x is initially 0, then the code ((x << 8) | b[0]) will sign extend 0xff to get 0xffffffff, and thus give the value 0xffffffff as the result.

#BIT: Check for sign of bitwise operation (BIT_SIGNED_CHECK_HIGH_BIT)
BIT_SIGNED_CHECK_HIGH_BIT=;SFP-1;CWE-195
BIT_SIGNED_CHECK_HIGH_BITMsg=This method compares an expression such as ((event.detail & SWT.SELECTED) > 0). Using bit arithmetic and then comparing with the greater than operator can lead to unexpected results (of course depending on the value of SWT.SELECTED). If SWT.SELECTED is a negative number, this is a candidate for a bug. Even when SWT.SELECTED is not negative, it seems good practice to use '!= 0' instead of '> 0'.

#BOA: Class overrides a method implemented in super class Adapter wrongly (BOA_BADLY_OVERRIDDEN_ADAPTER)
BOA_BADLY_OVERRIDDEN_ADAPTER=;SFP--1;CWE-710
BOA_BADLY_OVERRIDDEN_ADAPTERMsg=This method overrides a method found in a parent class, where that class is an Adapter that implements a listener defined in the java.awt.event or javax.swing.event package. As a result, this method will not get called when the event occurs.

#BSHIFT: Possible bad parsing of shift operation (BSHIFT_WRONG_ADD_PRIORITY)
BSHIFT_WRONG_ADD_PRIORITY=;SFP-1;CWE-783
BSHIFT_WRONG_ADD_PRIORITYMsg=The code performs an operation like (x << 8 + y). Although this might be correct, probably it was meant to perform (x << 8) + y, but shift operation has a lower precedence, so it's actually parsed as x << (8 + y).

#BSHIFT: 32 bit int shifted by an amount not in the range -31..31 (ICAST_BAD_SHIFT_AMOUNT)
ICAST_BAD_SHIFT_AMOUNT=;SFP-1;CWE-682
ICAST_BAD_SHIFT_AMOUNTMsg=The code performs shift of a 32 bit int by a constant amount outside the range 0..31. The effect of this is to use the lower 5 bits of the integer value to decide how much to shift by (e.g., shifting by 40 bits is the same as shifting by 8 bits, and shifting by 32 bits is the same as shifting by zero bits). This probably isn't want was expected, and it at least confusing.

#DLS: Useless increment in return statement (DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_INCREMENT_IN_RETURN)
DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_INCREMENT_IN_RETURN=;SFP-1;CWE-480
DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_INCREMENT_IN_RETURNMsg=This statement has a return such as return x++;. A postfix increment/decrement does not impact the value of the expression, so this increment/decrement has no effect. Please verify that this statement does the right thing.

#DLS: Dead store of class literal (DLS_DEAD_STORE_OF_CLASS_LITERAL)
DLS_DEAD_STORE_OF_CLASS_LITERAL=;SFP-2;CWE-563
DLS_DEAD_STORE_OF_CLASS_LITERALMsg=This instruction assigns a class literal to a variable and then never uses it. The behavior of this differs in Java 1.4 and in Java 5. In Java 1.4 and earlier, a reference to Foo.class would force the static initializer for Foo to be executed, if it has not been executed already. In Java 5 and later, it does not.See Sun's article on Java SE compatibility for more details and examples, and suggestions on how to force class initialization in Java 5.

#DLS: Overwritten increment (DLS_OVERWRITTEN_INCREMENT)
DLS_OVERWRITTEN_INCREMENT=;SFP--1;CWE-398
DLS_OVERWRITTEN_INCREMENTMsg=The code performs an increment operation (e.g., i++) and then immediately overwrites it. For example, i = i++ immediately overwrites the incremented value with the original value.

#DMI: Reversed method arguments (DMI_ARGUMENTS_WRONG_ORDER)
DMI_ARGUMENTS_WRONG_ORDER=;SFP-1;CWE-683
DMI_ARGUMENTS_WRONG_ORDERMsg=The arguments to this method call seem to be in the wrong order. For example, a call Preconditions.checkNotNull("message", message) has reserved arguments: the value to be checked is the first argument.

#DMI: Bad constant value for month (DMI_BAD_MONTH)
DMI_BAD_MONTH=;SFP-1;CWE-682
DMI_BAD_MONTHMsg=This code passes a constant month value outside the expected range of 0..11 to a method.

#DMI: BigDecimal constructed from double that isn't represented precisely (DMI_BIGDECIMAL_CONSTRUCTED_FROM_DOUBLE)
DMI_BIGDECIMAL_CONSTRUCTED_FROM_DOUBLE=;SFP-1;CWE-681
DMI_BIGDECIMAL_CONSTRUCTED_FROM_DOUBLEMsg=This code creates a BigDecimal from a double value that doesn't translate well to a decimal number. For example, one might assume that writing new BigDecimal(0.1) in Java creates a BigDecimal which is exactly equal to 0.1 (an unscaled value of 1, with a scale of 1), but it is actually equal to 0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625. You probably want to use the BigDecimal.valueOf(double d) method, which uses the String representation of the double to create the BigDecimal (e.g., BigDecimal.valueOf(0.1) gives 0.1).

#DMI: hasNext method invokes next (DMI_CALLING_NEXT_FROM_HASNEXT)
DMI_CALLING_NEXT_FROM_HASNEXT=;SFP--1;CWE-398
DMI_CALLING_NEXT_FROM_HASNEXTMsg=The hasNext() method invokes the next() method. This is almost certainly wrong, since the hasNext() method is not supposed to change the state of the iterator, and the next method is supposed to change the state of the iterator.

#DMI: Collections should not contain themselves (DMI_COLLECTIONS_SHOULD_NOT_CONTAIN_THEMSELVES)
DMI_COLLECTIONS_SHOULD_NOT_CONTAIN_THEMSELVES=;SFP--1;CWE-687
DMI_COLLECTIONS_SHOULD_NOT_CONTAIN_THEMSELVESMsg=This call to a generic collection's method would only make sense if a collection contained itself (e.g., if s.contains(s) were true). This is unlikely to be true and would cause problems if it were true (such as the computation of the hash code resulting in infinite recursion). It is likely that the wrong value is being passed as a parameter.

#DMI: D'oh! A nonsensical method invocation (DMI_DOH)
DMI_DOH=;SFP--1;CWE--1
DMI_DOHMsg=This partical method invocation doesn't make sense, for reasons that should be apparent from inspection.

#DMI: Invocation of hashCode on an array (DMI_INVOKING_HASHCODE_ON_ARRAY)
DMI_INVOKING_HASHCODE_ON_ARRAY=;SFP--1;CWE-398
DMI_INVOKING_HASHCODE_ON_ARRAYMsg=The code invokes hashCode on an array. Calling hashCode on an array returns the same value as System.identityHashCode, and ingores the contents and length of the array. If you need a hashCode that depends on the contents of an array a, use java.util.Arrays.hashCode(a).

#DMI: Double.longBitsToDouble invoked on an int (DMI_LONG_BITS_TO_DOUBLE_INVOKED_ON_INT)
DMI_LONG_BITS_TO_DOUBLE_INVOKED_ON_INT=;SFP--1;CWE-686
DMI_LONG_BITS_TO_DOUBLE_INVOKED_ON_INTMsg=The Double.longBitsToDouble method is invoked, but a 32 bit int value is passed as an argument. This almostly certainly is not intended and is unlikely to give the intended result.

#DMI: Vacuous call to collections (DMI_VACUOUS_SELF_COLLECTION_CALL)
DMI_VACUOUS_SELF_COLLECTION_CALL=;SFP--1;CWE-687
DMI_VACUOUS_SELF_COLLECTION_CALLMsg=This call doesn't make sense. For any collection c, calling c.containsAll(c) should always be true, and c.retainAll(c) should have no effect.

#Dm: Can't use reflection to check for presence of annotation without runtime retention (DMI_ANNOTATION_IS_NOT_VISIBLE_TO_REFLECTION)
DMI_ANNOTATION_IS_NOT_VISIBLE_TO_REFLECTION=;SFP--1;CWE-710
DMI_ANNOTATION_IS_NOT_VISIBLE_TO_REFLECTIONMsg=Unless an annotation has itself been annotated with @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME), the annotation can't be observed using reflection (e.g., by using the isAnnotationPresent method). 

#Dm: Futile attempt to change max pool size of ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor (DMI_FUTILE_ATTEMPT_TO_CHANGE_MAXPOOL_SIZE_OF_SCHEDULED_THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR)
DMI_FUTILE_ATTEMPT_TO_CHANGE_MAXPOOL_SIZE_OF_SCHEDULED_THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR=;SFP--1;CWE-398
DMI_FUTILE_ATTEMPT_TO_CHANGE_MAXPOOL_SIZE_OF_SCHEDULED_THREAD_POOL_EXECUTORMsg=While ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor inherits from ThreadPoolExecutor, a few of the inherited tuning methods are not useful for it. In particular, because it acts as a fixed-sized pool using corePoolSize threads and an unbounded queue, adjustments to maximumPoolSize have no useful effect.

#Dm: Creation of ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor with zero core threads (DMI_SCHEDULED_THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR_WITH_ZERO_CORE_THREADS)
DMI_SCHEDULED_THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR_WITH_ZERO_CORE_THREADS=;SFP--1;CWE-398
DMI_SCHEDULED_THREAD_POOL_EXECUTOR_WITH_ZERO_CORE_THREADSMsg=A ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor with zero core threads will never execute anything; changes to the max pool size are ignored.

#Dm: Useless/vacuous call to EasyMock method (DMI_VACUOUS_CALL_TO_EASYMOCK_METHOD)
DMI_VACUOUS_CALL_TO_EASYMOCK_METHOD=;SFP--1;CWE-398
DMI_VACUOUS_CALL_TO_EASYMOCK_METHODMsg=This call doesn't pass any objects to the EasyMock method, so the call doesn't do anything.

#Dm: Incorrect combination of Math.max and Math.min (DM_INVALID_MIN_MAX)
DM_INVALID_MIN_MAX=;SFP-1;CWE-683
DM_INVALID_MIN_MAXMsg=This code tries to limit the value bounds using the construct like Math.min(0, Math.max(100, value)). However the order of the constants is incorrect: it should be Math.min(100, Math.max(0, value)). As the result this code always produces the same result (or NaN if the value is NaN).

#EC: equals() used to compare array and nonarray (EC_ARRAY_AND_NONARRAY)
EC_ARRAY_AND_NONARRAY=;SFP-1;CWE-570
EC_ARRAY_AND_NONARRAYMsg=This method invokes the .equals(Object o) to compare an array and a reference that doesn't seem to be an array. If things being compared are of different types, they are guaranteed to be unequal and the comparison is almost certainly an error. Even if they are both arrays, the equals method on arrays only determines of the two arrays are the same object. To compare the contents of the arrays, use java.util.Arrays.equals(Object[], Object[]).

#EC: Invocation of equals() on an array, which is equivalent to == (EC_BAD_ARRAY_COMPARE)
EC_BAD_ARRAY_COMPARE=;SFP-1;CWE-570
EC_BAD_ARRAY_COMPAREMsg=This method invokes the .equals(Object o) method on an array. Since arrays do not override the equals method of Object, calling equals on an array is the same as comparing their addresses. To compare the contents of the arrays, use java.util.Arrays.equals(Object[], Object[]). To compare the addresses of the arrays, it would be less confusing to explicitly pointer equality using ==.

#EC: equals(...) used to compare incompatible arrays (EC_INCOMPATIBLE_ARRAY_COMPARE)
EC_INCOMPATIBLE_ARRAY_COMPARE=;SFP-1;CWE-570
EC_INCOMPATIBLE_ARRAY_COMPAREMsg=This method invokes the .equals(Object o) to compare two arrays, but the arrays of of incompatible types (e.g., String[] and StringBuffer[], or String[] and int[]). They will never be equal. In addition, when equals(...) is used to compare arrays it only checks to see if they are the same array, and ignores the contents of the arrays.

#EC: Call to equals(null) (EC_NULL_ARG)
EC_NULL_ARG=;SFP-1;CWE-570
EC_NULL_ARGMsg=This method calls equals(Object), passing a null value as the argument. According to the contract of the equals() method, this call should always return false.

#EC: Call to equals() comparing unrelated class and interface (EC_UNRELATED_CLASS_AND_INTERFACE)
EC_UNRELATED_CLASS_AND_INTERFACE=;SFP-1;CWE-570
EC_UNRELATED_CLASS_AND_INTERFACEMsg=This method calls equals(Object) on two references, one of which is a class and the other an interface, where neither the class nor any of its non-abstract subclasses implement the interface. Therefore, the objects being compared are unlikely to be members of the same class at runtime (unless some application classes were not analyzed, or dynamic class loading can occur at runtime). According to the contract of equals(), objects of different classes should always compare as unequal; therefore, according to the contract defined by java.lang.Object.equals(Object), the result of this comparison will always be false at runtime.

#EC: Call to equals() comparing different interface types (EC_UNRELATED_INTERFACES)
EC_UNRELATED_INTERFACES=;SFP-1;CWE-570
EC_UNRELATED_INTERFACESMsg=This method calls equals(Object) on two references of unrelated interface types, where neither is a subtype of the other, and there are no known non-abstract classes which implement both interfaces. Therefore, the objects being compared are unlikely to be members of the same class at runtime (unless some application classes were not analyzed, or dynamic class loading can occur at runtime). According to the contract of equals(), objects of different classes should always compare as unequal; therefore, according to the contract defined by java.lang.Object.equals(Object), the result of this comparison will always be false at runtime.

#EC: Call to equals() comparing different types (EC_UNRELATED_TYPES)
EC_UNRELATED_TYPES=;SFP-1;CWE-570
EC_UNRELATED_TYPESMsg=This method calls equals(Object) on two references of different class types with no common subclasses. Therefore, the objects being compared are unlikely to be members of the same class at runtime (unless some application classes were not analyzed, or dynamic class loading can occur at runtime). According to the contract of equals(), objects of different classes should always compare as unequal; therefore, according to the contract defined by java.lang.Object.equals(Object), the result of this comparison will always be false at runtime.

#EC: Using pointer equality to compare different types (EC_UNRELATED_TYPES_USING_POINTER_EQUALITY)
EC_UNRELATED_TYPES_USING_POINTER_EQUALITY=;SFP-1;CWE-570
EC_UNRELATED_TYPES_USING_POINTER_EQUALITYMsg=This method uses using pointer equality to compare two references that seem to be of different types. The result of this comparison will always be false at runtime.

#Eq: equals method always returns false (EQ_ALWAYS_FALSE)
EQ_ALWAYS_FALSE=;SFP-1;CWE-570
EQ_ALWAYS_FALSEMsg=This class defines an equals method that always returns false. This means that an object is not equal to itself, and it is impossible to create useful Maps or Sets of this class. More fundamentally, it means that equals is not reflexive, one of the requirements of the equals method. The likely intended semantics are object identity: that an object is equal to itself. This is the behavior inherited from class Object. If you need to override an equals inherited from a different superclass, you can use use: public boolean equals(Object o) { return this == o; }

#Eq: equals method always returns true (EQ_ALWAYS_TRUE)
EQ_ALWAYS_TRUE=;SFP-1;CWE-571
EQ_ALWAYS_TRUEMsg=This class defines an equals method that always returns true. This is imaginative, but not very smart. Plus, it means that the equals method is not symmetric.

#Eq: equals method compares class names rather than class objects (EQ_COMPARING_CLASS_NAMES)
EQ_COMPARING_CLASS_NAMES=;SFP-1;CWE-486
EQ_COMPARING_CLASS_NAMESMsg=This method checks to see if two objects are the same class by checking to see if the names of their classes are equal. You can have different classes with the same name if they are loaded by different class loaders. Just check to see if the class objects are the same.

#Eq: Covariant equals() method defined for enum (EQ_DONT_DEFINE_EQUALS_FOR_ENUM)
EQ_DONT_DEFINE_EQUALS_FOR_ENUM=;SFP--1;CWE-710
EQ_DONT_DEFINE_EQUALS_FOR_ENUMMsg=This class defines an enumeration, and equality on enumerations are defined using object identity. Defining a covariant equals method for an enumeration value is exceptionally bad practice, since it would likely result in having two different enumeration values that compare as equals using the covariant enum method, and as not equal when compared normally. Don't do it.

#Eq: equals() method defined that doesn't override equals(Object) (EQ_OTHER_NO_OBJECT)
EQ_OTHER_NO_OBJECT=;SFP-3;CWE-573
EQ_OTHER_NO_OBJECTMsg=This class defines an equals() method, that doesn't override the normal equals(Object) method defined in the base java.lang.Object class.  Instead, it inherits an equals(Object) method from a superclass. The class should probably define a boolean equals(Object) method.

#Eq: equals() method defined that doesn't override Object.equals(Object) (EQ_OTHER_USE_OBJECT)
EQ_OTHER_USE_OBJECT=;SFP-3;CWE-573
EQ_OTHER_USE_OBJECTMsg=This class defines an equals() method, that doesn't override the normal equals(Object) method defined in the base java.lang.Object class.  The class should probably define a boolean equals(Object) method.

#Eq: equals method overrides equals in superclass and may not be symmetric (EQ_OVERRIDING_EQUALS_NOT_SYMMETRIC)
EQ_OVERRIDING_EQUALS_NOT_SYMMETRIC=;SFP--1;CWE-710
EQ_OVERRIDING_EQUALS_NOT_SYMMETRICMsg=This class defines an equals method that overrides an equals method in a superclass. Both equals methods methods use instanceof in the determination of whether two objects are equal. This is fraught with peril, since it is important that the equals method is symmetrical (in other words, a.equals(b) == b.equals(a)). If B is a subtype of A, and A's equals method checks that the argument is an instanceof A, and B's equals method checks that the argument is an instanceof B, it is quite likely that the equivalence relation defined by these methods is not symmetric.

#Eq: Covariant equals() method defined, Object.equals(Object) inherited (EQ_SELF_USE_OBJECT)
EQ_SELF_USE_OBJECT=;SFP--1;CWE-710
EQ_SELF_USE_OBJECTMsg=This class defines a covariant version of the equals() method, but inherits the normal equals(Object) method defined in the base java.lang.Object class.  The class should probably define a boolean equals(Object) method.

#FE: Doomed test for equality to NaN (FE_TEST_IF_EQUAL_TO_NOT_A_NUMBER)
FE_TEST_IF_EQUAL_TO_NOT_A_NUMBER=;SFP-1;CWE-570
FE_TEST_IF_EQUAL_TO_NOT_A_NUMBERMsg=This code checks to see if a floating point value is equal to the special Not A Number value (e.g., if (x == Double.NaN)). However, because of the special semantics of NaN, no value is equal to Nan, including NaN. Thus, x == Double.NaN always evaluates to false. To check to see if a value contained in x is the special Not A Number value, use Double.isNaN(x) (or Float.isNaN(x) if x is floating point precision).

#FS: Format string placeholder incompatible with passed argument (VA_FORMAT_STRING_BAD_ARGUMENT)
VA_FORMAT_STRING_BAD_ARGUMENT=;SFP-1;CWE-687
VA_FORMAT_STRING_BAD_ARGUMENTMsg=The format string placeholder is incompatible with the corresponding argument. For example, System.out.println("%d\n", "hello"); The %d placeholder requires a numeric argument, but a string value is passed instead. A runtime exception will occur when this statement is executed.

#FS: The type of a supplied argument doesn't match format specifier (VA_FORMAT_STRING_BAD_CONVERSION)
VA_FORMAT_STRING_BAD_CONVERSION=;SFP-1;CWE-687
VA_FORMAT_STRING_BAD_CONVERSIONMsg=One of the arguments is uncompatible with the corresponding format string specifier. As a result, this will generate a runtime exception when executed. For example, String.format("%d", "1") will generate an exception, since the String "1" is incompatible with the format specifier %d.

#FS: MessageFormat supplied where printf style format expected (VA_FORMAT_STRING_EXPECTED_MESSAGE_FORMAT_SUPPLIED)
VA_FORMAT_STRING_EXPECTED_MESSAGE_FORMAT_SUPPLIED=;SFP-1;CWE-685
VA_FORMAT_STRING_EXPECTED_MESSAGE_FORMAT_SUPPLIEDMsg=A method is called that expects a Java printf format string and a list of arguments. However, the format string doesn't contain any format specifiers (e.g., %s) but does contain message format elements (e.g., {0}). It is likely that the code is supplying a MessageFormat string when a printf-style format string is required. At runtime, all of the arguments will be ignored and the format string will be returned exactly as provided without any formatting.

#FS: More arguments are passed than are actually used in the format string (VA_FORMAT_STRING_EXTRA_ARGUMENTS_PASSED)
VA_FORMAT_STRING_EXTRA_ARGUMENTS_PASSED=;SFP-1;CWE-685
VA_FORMAT_STRING_EXTRA_ARGUMENTS_PASSEDMsg=A format-string method with a variable number of arguments is called, but more arguments are passed than are actually used by the format string. This won't cause a runtime exception, but the code may be silently omitting information that was intended to be included in the formatted string.

#FS: Illegal format string (VA_FORMAT_STRING_ILLEGAL)
VA_FORMAT_STRING_ILLEGAL=;SFP-1;CWE-687
VA_FORMAT_STRING_ILLEGALMsg=The format string is syntactically invalid, and a runtime exception will occur when this statement is executed.

#FS: Format string references missing argument (VA_FORMAT_STRING_MISSING_ARGUMENT)
VA_FORMAT_STRING_MISSING_ARGUMENT=;SFP-1;CWE-685
VA_FORMAT_STRING_MISSING_ARGUMENTMsg=Not enough arguments are passed to satisfy a placeholder in the format string. A runtime exception will occur when this statement is executed.

#FS: No previous argument for format string (VA_FORMAT_STRING_NO_PREVIOUS_ARGUMENT)
VA_FORMAT_STRING_NO_PREVIOUS_ARGUMENT=;SFP-1;CWE-685
VA_FORMAT_STRING_NO_PREVIOUS_ARGUMENTMsg=The format string specifies a relative index to request that the argument for the previous format specifier be reused. However, there is no previous argument.

#GC: No relationship between generic parameter and method argument (GC_UNRELATED_TYPES)
GC_UNRELATED_TYPES=;SFP--1;CWE-687
GC_UNRELATED_TYPESMsg=This call to a generic collection method contains an argument with an incompatible class from that of the collection's parameter (i.e., the type of the argument is neither a supertype nor a subtype of the corresponding generic type argument). Therefore, it is unlikely that the collection contains any objects that are equal to the method argument used here. Most likely, the wrong value is being passed to the method. In general, instances of two unrelated classes are not equal. For example, if the Foo and Bar classes are not related by subtyping, then an instance of Foo should not be equal to an instance of Bar. Among other issues, doing so will likely result in an equals method that is not symmetrical. For example, if you define the Foo class so that a Foo can be equal to a String, your equals method isn't symmetrical since a String can only be equal to a String. In rare cases, people do define nonsymmetrical equals methods and still manage to make their code work. Although none of the APIs document or guarantee it, it is typically the case that if you check if a Collection<String> contains a Foo, the equals method of argument (e.g., the equals method of the Foo class) used to perform the equality checks.

#HE: Signature declares use of unhashable class in hashed construct (HE_SIGNATURE_DECLARES_HASHING_OF_UNHASHABLE_CLASS)
HE_SIGNATURE_DECLARES_HASHING_OF_UNHASHABLE_CLASS=;SFP--1;CWE-581
HE_SIGNATURE_DECLARES_HASHING_OF_UNHASHABLE_CLASSMsg=A method, field or class declares a generic signature where a non-hashable class is used in context where a hashable class is required. A class that declares an equals method but inherits a hashCode() method from Object is unhashable, since it doesn't fulfill the requirement that equal objects have equal hashCodes.

#HE: Use of class without a hashCode() method in a hashed data structure (HE_USE_OF_UNHASHABLE_CLASS)
HE_USE_OF_UNHASHABLE_CLASS=;SFP--1;CWE-581
HE_USE_OF_UNHASHABLE_CLASSMsg=A class defines an equals(Object) method but not a hashCode() method, and thus doesn't fulfill the requirement that equal objects have equal hashCodes. An instance of this class is used in a hash data structure, making the need to fix this problem of highest importance.

#ICAST: int value converted to long and used as absolute time (ICAST_INT_2_LONG_AS_INSTANT)
ICAST_INT_2_LONG_AS_INSTANT=;SFP-1;CWE-681
ICAST_INT_2_LONG_AS_INSTANTMsg=This code converts a 32-bit int value to a 64-bit long value, and then passes that value for a method parameter that requires an absolute time value. An absolute time value is the number of milliseconds since the standard base time known as "the epoch", namely January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT.

#ICAST: Integral value cast to double and then passed to Math.ceil (ICAST_INT_CAST_TO_DOUBLE_PASSED_TO_CEIL)
ICAST_INT_CAST_TO_DOUBLE_PASSED_TO_CEIL=;SFP--1;CWE-398
ICAST_INT_CAST_TO_DOUBLE_PASSED_TO_CEILMsg=This code converts an integral value (e.g., int or long) to a double precision floating point number and then passing the result to the Math.ceil() function, which rounds a double to the next higher integer value. This operation should always be a no-op, since the converting an integer to a double should give a number with no fractional part. It is likely that the operation that generated the value to be passed to Math.ceil was intended to be performed using double precision floating point arithmetic.

#ICAST: int value cast to float and then passed to Math.round (ICAST_INT_CAST_TO_FLOAT_PASSED_TO_ROUND)
ICAST_INT_CAST_TO_FLOAT_PASSED_TO_ROUND=;SFP--1;CWE-398
ICAST_INT_CAST_TO_FLOAT_PASSED_TO_ROUNDMsg=This code converts an int value to a float precision floating point number and then passing the result to the Math.round() function, which returns the int/long closest to the argument. This operation should always be a no-op, since the converting an integer to a float should give a number with no fractional part. It is likely that the operation that generated the value to be passed to Math.round was intended to be performed using floating point arithmetic.

#IJU: JUnit assertion in run method will not be noticed by JUnit (IJU_ASSERT_METHOD_INVOKED_FROM_RUN_METHOD)
IJU_ASSERT_METHOD_INVOKED_FROM_RUN_METHOD=;SFP--1;CWE-710
IJU_ASSERT_METHOD_INVOKED_FROM_RUN_METHODMsg=A JUnit assertion is performed in a run method. Failed JUnit assertions just result in exceptions being thrown. Thus, if this exception occurs in a thread other than the thread that invokes the test method, the exception will terminate the thread but not result in the test failing.

#IJU: TestCase declares a bad suite method (IJU_BAD_SUITE_METHOD)
IJU_BAD_SUITE_METHOD=;SFP--1;CWE-710
IJU_BAD_SUITE_METHODMsg=Class is a JUnit TestCase and defines a suite() method. However, the suite method needs to be declared as either public static junit.framework.Test suite() or public static junit.framework.TestSuite suite()

#IJU: TestCase has no tests (IJU_NO_TESTS)
IJU_NO_TESTS=;SFP--1;CWE-710
IJU_NO_TESTSMsg=Class is a JUnit TestCase but has not implemented any test methods

#IJU: TestCase defines setUp that doesn't call super.setUp() (IJU_SETUP_NO_SUPER)
IJU_SETUP_NO_SUPER=;SFP--1;CWE-710
IJU_SETUP_NO_SUPERMsg=Class is a JUnit TestCase and implements the setUp method. The setUp method should call super.setUp(), but doesn't.

#IJU: TestCase implements a non-static suite method (IJU_SUITE_NOT_STATIC)
IJU_SUITE_NOT_STATIC=;SFP--1;CWE-710
IJU_SUITE_NOT_STATICMsg=Class is a JUnit TestCase and implements the suite() method. The suite method should be declared as being static, but isn't.

#IJU: TestCase defines tearDown that doesn't call super.tearDown() (IJU_TEARDOWN_NO_SUPER)
IJU_TEARDOWN_NO_SUPER=;SFP--1;CWE-710
IJU_TEARDOWN_NO_SUPERMsg=Class is a JUnit TestCase and implements the tearDown method. The tearDown method should call super.tearDown(), but doesn't.

#IL: A collection is added to itself (IL_CONTAINER_ADDED_TO_ITSELF)
IL_CONTAINER_ADDED_TO_ITSELF=;SFP-13;CWE-674
IL_CONTAINER_ADDED_TO_ITSELFMsg=A collection is added to itself. As a result, computing the hashCode of this set will throw a StackOverflowException

#IL: An apparent infinite loop (IL_INFINITE_LOOP)
IL_INFINITE_LOOP=;SFP--1;CWE-835
IL_INFINITE_LOOPMsg=This loop doesn't seem to have a way to terminate (other than by perhaps throwing an exception).

#IL: An apparent infinite recursive loop (IL_INFINITE_RECURSIVE_LOOP)
IL_INFINITE_RECURSIVE_LOOP=;SFP-13;CWE-674
IL_INFINITE_RECURSIVE_LOOPMsg=This method unconditionally invokes itself. This would seem to indicate an infinite recursive loop that will result in a stack overflow.

#IM: Integer multiply of result of integer remainder (IM_MULTIPLYING_RESULT_OF_IREM)
IM_MULTIPLYING_RESULT_OF_IREM=;SFP--1;CWE-398
IM_MULTIPLYING_RESULT_OF_IREMMsg=The code multiplies the result of an integer remaining by an integer constant. Be sure you don't have your operator precedence confused. For example i % 60 * 1000 is (i % 60) * 1000, not i % (60 * 1000).

#INT: Bad comparison of int value with long constant (INT_BAD_COMPARISON_WITH_INT_VALUE)
INT_BAD_COMPARISON_WITH_INT_VALUE=;SFP--1;CWE-596
INT_BAD_COMPARISON_WITH_INT_VALUEMsg=This code compares an int value with a long constant that is outside the range of values that can be represented as an int value. This comparison is vacuous and possibily to be incorrect.

#INT: Bad comparison of nonnegative value with negative constant or zero (INT_BAD_COMPARISON_WITH_NONNEGATIVE_VALUE)
INT_BAD_COMPARISON_WITH_NONNEGATIVE_VALUE=;SFP--1;CWE-398
INT_BAD_COMPARISON_WITH_NONNEGATIVE_VALUEMsg=This code compares a value that is guaranteed to be non-negative with a negative constant.

#INT: Bad comparison of signed byte (INT_BAD_COMPARISON_WITH_SIGNED_BYTE)
INT_BAD_COMPARISON_WITH_SIGNED_BYTE=;SFP--1;CWE-195
INT_BAD_COMPARISON_WITH_SIGNED_BYTEMsg=Signed bytes can only have a value in the range -128 to 127. Comparing a signed byte with a value outside that range is vacuous and likely to be incorrect. To convert a signed byte b to an unsigned value in the range 0..255, use 0xff & b

#IO: Doomed attempt to append to an object output stream (IO_APPENDING_TO_OBJECT_OUTPUT_STREAM)
IO_APPENDING_TO_OBJECT_OUTPUT_STREAM=;SFP--1;CWE-398
IO_APPENDING_TO_OBJECT_OUTPUT_STREAMMsg=This code opens a file in append mode and then wraps the result in an object output stream. This won't allow you to append to an existing object output stream stored in a file. If you want to be able to append to an object output stream, you need to keep the object output stream open. The only situation in which opening a file in append mode and the writing an object output stream could work is if on reading the file you plan to open it in random access mode and seek to the byte offset where the append started.

#IP: A parameter is dead upon entry to a method but overwritten (IP_PARAMETER_IS_DEAD_BUT_OVERWRITTEN)
IP_PARAMETER_IS_DEAD_BUT_OVERWRITTEN=;SFP--1;CWE-398
IP_PARAMETER_IS_DEAD_BUT_OVERWRITTENMsg=The initial value of this parameter is ignored, and the parameter is overwritten here. This often indicates a mistaken belief that the write to the parameter will be conveyed back to the caller.

#MF: Class defines field that masks a superclass field (MF_CLASS_MASKS_FIELD)
MF_CLASS_MASKS_FIELD=;SFP--1;CWE-710
MF_CLASS_MASKS_FIELDMsg=This class defines a field with the same name as a visible instance field in a superclass. This is confusing, and may indicate an error if methods update or access one of the fields when they wanted the other.

#MF: Method defines a variable that obscures a field (MF_METHOD_MASKS_FIELD)
MF_METHOD_MASKS_FIELD=;SFP--1;CWE-710
MF_METHOD_MASKS_FIELDMsg=This method defines a local variable with the same name as a field in this class or a superclass. This may cause the method to read an uninitialized value from the field, leave the field uninitialized, or both.

#NP: Null pointer dereference (NP_ALWAYS_NULL)
NP_ALWAYS_NULL=;SFP-7;CWE-476
NP_ALWAYS_NULLMsg=A null pointer is dereferenced here.  This will lead to a NullPointerException when the code is executed.

#NP: Null pointer dereference in method on exception path (NP_ALWAYS_NULL_EXCEPTION)
NP_ALWAYS_NULL_EXCEPTION=;SFP-7;CWE-476
NP_ALWAYS_NULL_EXCEPTIONMsg=A pointer which is null on an exception path is dereferenced here.  This will lead to a NullPointerException when the code is executed.  Note that because FindBugs currently does not prune infeasible exception paths, this may be a false warning. Also note that FindBugs considers the default case of a switch statement to be an exception path, since the default case is often infeasible.

#NP: Method does not check for null argument (NP_ARGUMENT_MIGHT_BE_NULL)
NP_ARGUMENT_MIGHT_BE_NULL=;SFP-7;CWE-476
NP_ARGUMENT_MIGHT_BE_NULLMsg=A parameter to this method has been identified as a value that should always be checked to see whether or not it is null, but it is being dereferenced without a preceding null check.

#NP: close() invoked on a value that is always null (NP_CLOSING_NULL)
NP_CLOSING_NULL=;SFP-7;CWE-476
NP_CLOSING_NULLMsg=close() is being invoked on a value that is always null. If this statement is executed, a null pointer exception will occur. But the big risk here you never close something that should be closed.

#NP: Null value is guaranteed to be dereferenced (NP_GUARANTEED_DEREF)
NP_GUARANTEED_DEREF=;SFP-7;CWE-476
NP_GUARANTEED_DEREFMsg=There is a statement or branch that if executed guarantees that a value is null at this point, and that value that is guaranteed to be dereferenced (except on forward paths involving runtime exceptions).

#NP: Value is null and guaranteed to be dereferenced on exception path (NP_GUARANTEED_DEREF_ON_EXCEPTION_PATH)
NP_GUARANTEED_DEREF_ON_EXCEPTION_PATH=;SFP-7;CWE-476
NP_GUARANTEED_DEREF_ON_EXCEPTION_PATHMsg=There is a statement or branch on an exception path that if executed guarantees that a value is null at this point, and that value that is guaranteed to be dereferenced (except on forward paths involving runtime exceptions).

NP_NONNULL_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR=;SFP-7;CWE-476
NP_NONNULL_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTORMsg=The field is marked as non-null, but isn't written to by the constructor. The field might be initialized elsewhere during constructor, or might always be initialized before use.

#NP: Method call passes null to a non-null parameter (NP_NONNULL_PARAM_VIOLATION)
NP_NONNULL_PARAM_VIOLATION=;SFP-7;CWE-476
NP_NONNULL_PARAM_VIOLATIONMsg=This method passes a null value as the parameter of a method which must be nonnull. Either this parameter has been explicitly marked as @Nonnull, or analysis has determined that this parameter is always dereferenced.

#NP: Method may return null, but is declared @Nonnull (NP_NONNULL_RETURN_VIOLATION)
NP_NONNULL_RETURN_VIOLATION=;SFP-7;CWE-476
NP_NONNULL_RETURN_VIOLATIONMsg=This method may return a null value, but the method (or a superclass method which it overrides) is declared to return @NonNull.

#NP: A known null value is checked to see if it is an instance of a type (NP_NULL_INSTANCEOF)
NP_NULL_INSTANCEOF=;SFP-1;CWE-570
NP_NULL_INSTANCEOFMsg=This instanceof test will always return false, since the value being checked is guaranteed to be null. Although this is safe, make sure it isn't an indication of some misunderstanding or some other logic error.

#NP: Possible null pointer dereference (NP_NULL_ON_SOME_PATH)
NP_NULL_ON_SOME_PATH=;SFP-7;CWE-476
NP_NULL_ON_SOME_PATHMsg=There is a branch of statement that, if executed, guarantees that a null value will be dereferenced, which would generate a NullPointerException when the code is executed. Of course, the problem might be that the branch or statement is infeasible and that the null pointer exception can't ever be executed; deciding that is beyond the ability of FindBugs.

#NP: Possible null pointer dereference in method on exception path (NP_NULL_ON_SOME_PATH_EXCEPTION)
NP_NULL_ON_SOME_PATH_EXCEPTION=;SFP-7;CWE-476
NP_NULL_ON_SOME_PATH_EXCEPTIONMsg=A reference value which is null on some exception control path is dereferenced here.  This may lead to a NullPointerException when the code is executed.  Note that because FindBugs currently does not prune infeasible exception paths, this may be a false warning. Also note that FindBugs considers the default case of a switch statement to be an exception path, since the default case is often infeasible.

NP_NULL_PARAM_DEREF=;SFP-7;CWE-476
NP_NULL_PARAM_DEREFMsg=This method call passes a null value for a nonnull method parameter. Either the parameter is annotated as a parameter that should always be nonnull, or analysis has shown that it will always be dereferenced.

#NP: Method call passes null for non-null parameter (NP_NULL_PARAM_DEREF_ALL_TARGETS_DANGEROUS)
NP_NULL_PARAM_DEREF_ALL_TARGETS_DANGEROUS=;SFP-7;CWE-476
NP_NULL_PARAM_DEREF_ALL_TARGETS_DANGEROUSMsg=A possibly-null value is passed at a call site where all known target methods require the parameter to be nonnull. Either the parameter is annotated as a parameter that should always be nonnull, or analysis has shown that it will always be dereferenced.

#NP: Non-virtual method call passes null for non-null parameter (NP_NULL_PARAM_DEREF_NONVIRTUAL)
NP_NULL_PARAM_DEREF_NONVIRTUAL=;SFP-7;CWE-476
NP_NULL_PARAM_DEREF_NONVIRTUALMsg=A possibly-null value is passed to a nonnull method parameter. Either the parameter is annotated as a parameter that should always be nonnull, or analysis has shown that it will always be dereferenced.

#NP: Method with Optional return type returns explicit null (NP_OPTIONAL_RETURN_NULL)
NP_OPTIONAL_RETURN_NULL=;SFP-7;CWE-476
NP_OPTIONAL_RETURN_NULLMsg=The usage of Optional return type (java.util.Optional or com.google.common.base.Optiona) always mean that explicit null returns were not desired by design. Returning a null value in such case is a contract violation and will most likely break clients code.

#NP: Store of null value into field annotated @Nonnull (NP_STORE_INTO_NONNULL_FIELD)
NP_STORE_INTO_NONNULL_FIELD=;SFP-7;CWE-476
NP_STORE_INTO_NONNULL_FIELDMsg=A value that could be null is stored into a field that has been annotated as NonNull.

NP_UNWRITTEN_FIELD=;SFP-7;CWE-476
NP_UNWRITTEN_FIELDMsg=The program is dereferencing a field that does not seem to ever have a non-null value written to it. Dereferencing this value will generate a null pointer exception.

#Nm: Class defines equal(Object); should it be equals(Object)? (NM_BAD_EQUAL)
NM_BAD_EQUAL=;SFP--1;CWE-710
NM_BAD_EQUALMsg=This class defines a method equal(Object).  This method does not override the equals(Object) method in java.lang.Object, which is probably what was intended.

#Nm: Class defines hashcode(); should it be hashCode()? (NM_LCASE_HASHCODE)
NM_LCASE_HASHCODE=;SFP--1;CWE-710
NM_LCASE_HASHCODEMsg=This class defines a method called hashcode().  This method does not override the hashCode() method in java.lang.Object, which is probably what was intended.

#Nm: Class defines tostring(); should it be toString()? (NM_LCASE_TOSTRING)
NM_LCASE_TOSTRING=;SFP--1;CWE-710
NM_LCASE_TOSTRINGMsg=This class defines a method called tostring().  This method does not override the toString() method in java.lang.Object, which is probably what was intended.

#Nm: Apparent method/constructor confusion (NM_METHOD_CONSTRUCTOR_CONFUSION)
NM_METHOD_CONSTRUCTOR_CONFUSION=;SFP--1;CWE-710
NM_METHOD_CONSTRUCTOR_CONFUSIONMsg=This regular method has the same name as the class it is defined in. It is likely that this was intended to be a constructor. If it was intended to be a constructor, remove the declaration of a void return value. If you had accidently defined this method, realized the mistake, defined a proper constructor but can't get rid of this method due to backwards compatibility, deprecate the method.

#Nm: Very confusing method names (NM_VERY_CONFUSING)
NM_VERY_CONFUSING=;SFP--1;CWE-710
NM_VERY_CONFUSINGMsg=The referenced methods have names that differ only by capitalization. This is very confusing because if the capitalization were identical then one of the methods would override the other.

#Nm: Method doesn't override method in superclass due to wrong package for parameter (NM_WRONG_PACKAGE)
NM_WRONG_PACKAGE=;SFP--1;CWE-710
NM_WRONG_PACKAGEMsg=The method in the subclass doesn't override a similar method in a superclass because the type of a parameter doesn't exactly match the type of the corresponding parameter in the superclass.

#QBA: Method assigns boolean literal in boolean expression (QBA_QUESTIONABLE_BOOLEAN_ASSIGNMENT)
QBA_QUESTIONABLE_BOOLEAN_ASSIGNMENT=;SFP-1;CWE-481
QBA_QUESTIONABLE_BOOLEAN_ASSIGNMENTMsg=This method assigns a literal boolean value (true or false) to a boolean variable inside an if or while expression. Most probably this was supposed to be a boolean comparison using ==, not an assignment using =.

#RANGE: Array index is out of bounds (RANGE_ARRAY_INDEX)
RANGE_ARRAY_INDEX=;SFP-8;CWE-119
RANGE_ARRAY_INDEXMsg=Array operation is performed, but array index is out of bounds, which will result in ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException at runtime.

#RANGE: Array length is out of bounds (RANGE_ARRAY_LENGTH)
RANGE_ARRAY_LENGTH=;SFP-8;CWE-119
RANGE_ARRAY_LENGTHMsg=Method is called with array parameter and length parameter, but the length is out of bounds. This will result in IndexOutOfBoundsException at runtime.

#RANGE: Array offset is out of bounds (RANGE_ARRAY_OFFSET)
RANGE_ARRAY_OFFSET=;SFP-8;CWE-119
RANGE_ARRAY_OFFSETMsg=Method is called with array parameter and offset parameter, but the offset is out of bounds. This will result in IndexOutOfBoundsException at runtime.

#RC: Suspicious reference comparison (RC_REF_COMPARISON)
RC_REF_COMPARISON=;SFP-1;CWE-597
RC_REF_COMPARISONMsg=This method compares two reference values using the == or != operator, where the correct way to compare instances of this type is generally with the equals() method. It is possible to create distinct instances that are equal but do not compare as == since they are different objects. Examples of classes which should generally not be compared by reference are java.lang.Integer, java.lang.Float, etc.

#RCN: Nullcheck of value previously dereferenced (RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_WOULD_HAVE_BEEN_A_NPE)
RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_WOULD_HAVE_BEEN_A_NPE=;SFP-7;CWE-476
RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_WOULD_HAVE_BEEN_A_NPEMsg=A value is checked here to see whether it is null, but this value can't be null because it was previously dereferenced and if it were null a null pointer exception would have occurred at the earlier dereference. Essentially, this code and the previous dereference disagree as to whether this value is allowed to be null. Either the check is redundant or the previous dereference is erroneous.

#RE: Invalid syntax for regular expression (RE_BAD_SYNTAX_FOR_REGULAR_EXPRESSION)
RE_BAD_SYNTAX_FOR_REGULAR_EXPRESSION=;SFP--1;CWE-687
RE_BAD_SYNTAX_FOR_REGULAR_EXPRESSIONMsg=The code here uses a regular expression that is invalid according to the syntax for regular expressions. This statement will throw a PatternSyntaxException when executed.

RE_CANT_USE_FILE_SEPARATOR_AS_REGULAR_EXPRESSION=;SFP--1;CWE-687
RE_CANT_USE_FILE_SEPARATOR_AS_REGULAR_EXPRESSIONMsg=The code here uses File.separator where a regular expression is required. This will fail on Windows platforms, where the File.separator is a backslash, which is interpreted in a regular expression as an escape character. Amoung other options, you can just use File.separatorChar=='\\' ? "\\\\" : File.separator instead of File.separator

#RE: "." or "|" used for regular expression (RE_POSSIBLE_UNINTENDED_PATTERN)
RE_POSSIBLE_UNINTENDED_PATTERN=;SFP--1;CWE-687
RE_POSSIBLE_UNINTENDED_PATTERNMsg=A String function is being invoked and "." is being passed to a parameter that takes a regular expression as an argument. Is this what you intended? For example s.replaceAll(".", "/") will return a String in which every character has been replaced by a / character, and s.split(".") always returns a zero length array of String.

#RV: Random value from 0 to 1 is coerced to the integer 0 (RV_01_TO_INT)
RV_01_TO_INT=;SFP-1;CWE-197
RV_01_TO_INTMsg=A random value from 0 to 1 is being coerced to the integer value 0. You probably want to multiple the random value by something else before coercing it to an integer, or use the Random.nextInt(n) method.

#RV: Bad attempt to compute absolute value of signed 32-bit hashcode (RV_ABSOLUTE_VALUE_OF_HASHCODE)
RV_ABSOLUTE_VALUE_OF_HASHCODE=;SFP-1;CWE-197
RV_ABSOLUTE_VALUE_OF_HASHCODEMsg=This code generates a hashcode and then computes the absolute value of that hashcode. If the hashcode is Integer.MIN_VALUE, then the result will be negative as well (since Math.abs(Integer.MIN_VALUE) == Integer.MIN_VALUE). One out of 2^32 strings have a hashCode of Integer.MIN_VALUE, including "polygenelubricants" "GydZG_" and ""DESIGNING WORKHOUSES".

#RV: Bad attempt to compute absolute value of signed random integer (RV_ABSOLUTE_VALUE_OF_RANDOM_INT)
RV_ABSOLUTE_VALUE_OF_RANDOM_INT=;SFP-1;CWE--1
RV_ABSOLUTE_VALUE_OF_RANDOM_INTMsg=This code generates a random signed integer and then computes the absolute value of that random integer. If the number returned by the random number generator is Integer.MIN_VALUE, then the result will be negative as well (since Math.abs(Integer.MIN_VALUE) == Integer.MIN_VALUE).

#RV: Code checks for specific values returned by compareTo (RV_CHECK_COMPARETO_FOR_SPECIFIC_RETURN_VALUE)
RV_CHECK_COMPARETO_FOR_SPECIFIC_RETURN_VALUE=;SFP--1;CWE-398
RV_CHECK_COMPARETO_FOR_SPECIFIC_RETURN_VALUEMsg=This code invoked a compareTo or compare method, and checks to see if the return value is a specific value, such as 1 or -1. When invoking these methods, you should only check the sign of the result, not for any specific non-zero value. While many or most compareTo and compare methods only return -1, 0 or 1, some of them will return other values.

#RV: Exception created and dropped rather than thrown (RV_EXCEPTION_NOT_THROWN)
RV_EXCEPTION_NOT_THROWN=;SFP-4;CWE-390
RV_EXCEPTION_NOT_THROWNMsg=This code creates an exception (or error) object, but doesn't do anything with it.

#RV: Method ignores return value (RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED)
RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED=;SFP-4;CWE-252
RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNOREDMsg=The return value of this method should be checked. One common cause of this warning is to invoke a method on an immutable object, thinking that it updates the object.

#RpC: Repeated conditional tests (RpC_REPEATED_CONDITIONAL_TEST)
RpC_REPEATED_CONDITIONAL_TEST=;SFP--1;CWE-398
RpC_REPEATED_CONDITIONAL_TESTMsg=The code contains a conditional test is performed twice, one right after the other (e.g., x == 0 || x == 0). Perhaps the second occurrence is intended to be something else (e.g., x == 0 || y == 0).

#SA: Self assignment of field (SA_FIELD_SELF_ASSIGNMENT)
SA_FIELD_SELF_ASSIGNMENT=;SFP--1;CWE-398
SA_FIELD_SELF_ASSIGNMENTMsg=This method contains a self assignment of a field

#SA: Self comparison of field with itself (SA_FIELD_SELF_COMPARISON)
SA_FIELD_SELF_COMPARISON=;SFP--1;CWE-398
SA_FIELD_SELF_COMPARISONMsg=This method compares a field with itself, and may indicate a typo or a logic error. Make sure that you are comparing the right things.

#SA: Nonsensical self computation involving a field (e.g., x & x) (SA_FIELD_SELF_COMPUTATION)
SA_FIELD_SELF_COMPUTATION=;SFP--1;CWE-398
SA_FIELD_SELF_COMPUTATIONMsg=This method performs a nonsensical computation of a field with another reference to the same field (e.g., x&x or x-x). Because of the nature of the computation, this operation doesn't seem to make sense, and may indicate a typo or a logic error. Double check the computation.

#SA: Self assignment of local rather than assignment to field (SA_LOCAL_SELF_ASSIGNMENT_INSTEAD_OF_FIELD)
SA_LOCAL_SELF_ASSIGNMENT_INSTEAD_OF_FIELD=;SFP--1;CWE-398
SA_LOCAL_SELF_ASSIGNMENT_INSTEAD_OF_FIELDMsg=This method contains a self assignment of a local variable, and there is a field with an identical name.

#SA: Self comparison of value with itself (SA_LOCAL_SELF_COMPARISON)
SA_LOCAL_SELF_COMPARISON=;SFP--1;CWE-398
SA_LOCAL_SELF_COMPARISONMsg=This method compares a local variable with itself, and may indicate a typo or a logic error. Make sure that you are comparing the right things.

#SA: Nonsensical self computation involving a variable (e.g., x & x) (SA_LOCAL_SELF_COMPUTATION)
SA_LOCAL_SELF_COMPUTATION=;SFP--1;CWE-398
SA_LOCAL_SELF_COMPUTATIONMsg=This method performs a nonsensical computation of a local variable with another reference to the same variable (e.g., x&x or x-x). Because of the nature of the computation, this operation doesn't seem to make sense, and may indicate a typo or a logic error. Double check the computation.

#SF: Dead store due to switch statement fall through (SF_DEAD_STORE_DUE_TO_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGH)
SF_DEAD_STORE_DUE_TO_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGH=;SFP-4;CWE-484
SF_DEAD_STORE_DUE_TO_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGHMsg=A value stored in the previous switch case is overwritten here due to a switch fall through. It is likely that you forgot to put a break or return at the end of the previous case.

#SF: Dead store due to switch statement fall through to throw (SF_DEAD_STORE_DUE_TO_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGH_TO_THROW)
SF_DEAD_STORE_DUE_TO_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGH_TO_THROW=;SFP-4;CWE-484
SF_DEAD_STORE_DUE_TO_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGH_TO_THROWMsg=A value stored in the previous switch case is ignored here due to a switch fall through to a place where an exception is thrown. It is likely that you forgot to put a break or return at the end of the previous case.

#SIC: Deadly embrace of non-static inner class and thread local (SIC_THREADLOCAL_DEADLY_EMBRACE)
SIC_THREADLOCAL_DEADLY_EMBRACE=;SFP--1;CWE-398
SIC_THREADLOCAL_DEADLY_EMBRACEMsg=This class is an inner class, but should probably be a static inner class. As it is, there is a serious danger of a deadly embrace between the inner class and the thread local in the outer class. Because the inner class isn't static, it retains a reference to the outer class. If the thread local contains a reference to an instance of the inner class, the inner and outer instance will both be reachable and not eligible for garbage collection.

#SIO: Unnecessary type check done using instanceof operator (SIO_SUPERFLUOUS_INSTANCEOF)
SIO_SUPERFLUOUS_INSTANCEOF=;SFP--1;CWE-398
SIO_SUPERFLUOUS_INSTANCEOFMsg=Type check performed using the instanceof operator where it can be statically determined whether the object is of the type requested.

#SQL: Method attempts to access a prepared statement parameter with index 0 (SQL_BAD_PREPARED_STATEMENT_ACCESS)
SQL_BAD_PREPARED_STATEMENT_ACCESS=;SFP-1;CWE-687
SQL_BAD_PREPARED_STATEMENT_ACCESSMsg=A call to a setXXX method of a prepared statement was made where the parameter index is 0. As parameter indexes start at index 1, this is always a mistake.

#SQL: Method attempts to access a result set field with index 0 (SQL_BAD_RESULTSET_ACCESS)
SQL_BAD_RESULTSET_ACCESS=;SFP-1;CWE-687
SQL_BAD_RESULTSET_ACCESSMsg=A call to getXXX or updateXXX methods of a result set was made where the field index is 0. As ResultSet fields start at index 1, this is always a mistake.

#STI: Unneeded use of currentThread() call, to call interrupted() (STI_INTERRUPTED_ON_CURRENTTHREAD)
STI_INTERRUPTED_ON_CURRENTTHREAD=;SFP--1;CWE-398
STI_INTERRUPTED_ON_CURRENTTHREADMsg=This method invokes the Thread.currentThread() call, just to call the interrupted() method. As interrupted() is a static method, is more simple and clear to use Thread.interrupted().

#STI: Static Thread.interrupted() method invoked on thread instance (STI_INTERRUPTED_ON_UNKNOWNTHREAD)
STI_INTERRUPTED_ON_UNKNOWNTHREAD=;SFP--1;CWE-398
STI_INTERRUPTED_ON_UNKNOWNTHREADMsg=This method invokes the Thread.interrupted() method on a Thread object that appears to be a Thread object that is not the current thread. As the interrupted() method is static, the interrupted method will be called on a different object than the one the author intended.

#Se: Method must be private in order for serialization to work (SE_METHOD_MUST_BE_PRIVATE)
SE_METHOD_MUST_BE_PRIVATE=;SFP--1;CWE-710
SE_METHOD_MUST_BE_PRIVATEMsg=This class implements the Serializable interface, and defines a method for custom serialization/deserialization. But since that method isn't declared private, it will be silently ignored by the serialization/deserialization API.

#Se: The readResolve method must not be declared as a static method. (SE_READ_RESOLVE_IS_STATIC)
SE_READ_RESOLVE_IS_STATIC=;SFP--1;CWE-710
SE_READ_RESOLVE_IS_STATICMsg=In order for the readResolve method to be recognized by the serialization mechanism, it must not be declared as a static method.

#TQ: Value annotated as carrying a type qualifier used where a value that must not carry that qualifier is required (TQ_ALWAYS_VALUE_USED_WHERE_NEVER_REQUIRED)
TQ_ALWAYS_VALUE_USED_WHERE_NEVER_REQUIRED=;SFP--1;CWE-710
TQ_ALWAYS_VALUE_USED_WHERE_NEVER_REQUIREDMsg=A value specified as carrying a type qualifier annotation is consumed in a location or locations requiring that the value not carry that annotation.

#TQ: Comparing values with incompatible type qualifiers (TQ_COMPARING_VALUES_WITH_INCOMPATIBLE_TYPE_QUALIFIERS)
TQ_COMPARING_VALUES_WITH_INCOMPATIBLE_TYPE_QUALIFIERS=;SFP--1;CWE-596
TQ_COMPARING_VALUES_WITH_INCOMPATIBLE_TYPE_QUALIFIERSMsg=A value specified as carrying a type qualifier annotation is compared with a value that doesn't ever carry that qualifier.

#TQ: Value that might not carry a type qualifier is always used in a way requires that type qualifier (TQ_MAYBE_SOURCE_VALUE_REACHES_ALWAYS_SINK)
TQ_MAYBE_SOURCE_VALUE_REACHES_ALWAYS_SINK=;SFP--1;CWE-710
TQ_MAYBE_SOURCE_VALUE_REACHES_ALWAYS_SINKMsg=A value that is annotated as possibility not being an instance of the values denoted by the type qualifier, and the value is guaranteed to be used in a way that requires values denoted by that type qualifier.

#TQ: Value that might carry a type qualifier is always used in a way prohibits it from having that type qualifier (TQ_MAYBE_SOURCE_VALUE_REACHES_NEVER_SINK)
TQ_MAYBE_SOURCE_VALUE_REACHES_NEVER_SINK=;SFP--1;CWE-710
TQ_MAYBE_SOURCE_VALUE_REACHES_NEVER_SINKMsg=A value that is annotated as possibility being an instance of the values denoted by the type qualifier, and the value is guaranteed to be used in a way that prohibits values denoted by that type qualifier.

#TQ: Value annotated as never carrying a type qualifier used where value carrying that qualifier is required (TQ_NEVER_VALUE_USED_WHERE_ALWAYS_REQUIRED)
TQ_NEVER_VALUE_USED_WHERE_ALWAYS_REQUIRED=;SFP--1;CWE-710
TQ_NEVER_VALUE_USED_WHERE_ALWAYS_REQUIREDMsg=A value specified as not carrying a type qualifier annotation is guaranteed to be consumed in a location or locations requiring that the value does carry that annotation. More precisely, a value annotated with a type qualifier specifying when=NEVER is guaranteed to reach a use or uses where the same type qualifier specifies when=ALWAYS.

#TQ: Value without a type qualifier used where a value is required to have that qualifier (TQ_UNKNOWN_VALUE_USED_WHERE_ALWAYS_STRICTLY_REQUIRED)
TQ_UNKNOWN_VALUE_USED_WHERE_ALWAYS_STRICTLY_REQUIRED=;SFP--1;CWE-398
TQ_UNKNOWN_VALUE_USED_WHERE_ALWAYS_STRICTLY_REQUIREDMsg=A value is being used in a way that requires the value be annotation with a type qualifier. The type qualifier is strict, so the tool rejects any values that do not have the appropriate annotation.

#UMAC: Uncallable method defined in anonymous class (UMAC_UNCALLABLE_METHOD_OF_ANONYMOUS_CLASS)
UMAC_UNCALLABLE_METHOD_OF_ANONYMOUS_CLASS=;SFP-2;CWE-561
UMAC_UNCALLABLE_METHOD_OF_ANONYMOUS_CLASSMsg=This anonymous class defined a method that is not directly invoked and does not override a method in a superclass. Since methods in other classes cannot directly invoke methods declared in an anonymous class, it seems that this method is uncallable. The method might simply be dead code, but it is also possible that the method is intended to override a method declared in a superclass, and due to an typo or other error the method does not, in fact, override the method it is intended to.

#UR: Uninitialized read of field in constructor (UR_UNINIT_READ)
UR_UNINIT_READ=;SFP-1;CWE-457
UR_UNINIT_READMsg=This constructor reads a field which has not yet been assigned a value.  This is often caused when the programmer mistakenly uses the field instead of one of the constructor's parameters.

#UR: Uninitialized read of field method called from constructor of superclass (UR_UNINIT_READ_CALLED_FROM_SUPER_CONSTRUCTOR)
UR_UNINIT_READ_CALLED_FROM_SUPER_CONSTRUCTOR=;SFP-1;CWE-457
UR_UNINIT_READ_CALLED_FROM_SUPER_CONSTRUCTORMsg=This method is invoked in the constructor of of the superclass. At this point, the fields of the class have not yet initialized.

#UwF: Field only ever set to null (UWF_NULL_FIELD)
UWF_NULL_FIELD=;SFP--1;CWE-398
UWF_NULL_FIELDMsg=All writes to this field are of the constant value null, and thus all reads of the field will return null. Check for errors, or remove it if it is useless.

#UwF: Unwritten field (UWF_UNWRITTEN_FIELD)
UWF_UNWRITTEN_FIELD=;SFP-1;CWE-456
UWF_UNWRITTEN_FIELDMsg=This field is never written.  All reads of it will return the default value. Check for errors (should it have been initialized?), or remove it if it is useless.

#VA: Primitive array passed to function expecting a variable number of object arguments (VA_PRIMITIVE_ARRAY_PASSED_TO_OBJECT_VARARG)
VA_PRIMITIVE_ARRAY_PASSED_TO_OBJECT_VARARG=;SFP-1;CWE-704
VA_PRIMITIVE_ARRAY_PASSED_TO_OBJECT_VARARGMsg=This code passes a primitive array to a function that takes a variable number of object arguments. This creates an array of length one to hold the primitive array and passes it to the function.

#LG: Potential lost logger changes due to weak reference in OpenJDK (LG_LOST_LOGGER_DUE_TO_WEAK_REFERENCE)
LG_LOST_LOGGER_DUE_TO_WEAK_REFERENCE=;SFP-3;CWE-474
LG_LOST_LOGGER_DUE_TO_WEAK_REFERENCEMsg=OpenJDK introduces a potential incompatibility. In particular, the java.util.logging.Logger behavior has changed. Instead of using strong references, it now uses weak references internally. That's a reasonable change, but unfortunately some code relies on the old behavior - when changing logger configuration, it simply drops the logger reference. That means that the garbage collector is free to reclaim that memory, which means that the logger configuration is lost.

#OBL: Method may fail to clean up stream or resource (OBL_UNSATISFIED_OBLIGATION)
OBL_UNSATISFIED_OBLIGATION=;SFP-14;CWE-404
OBL_UNSATISFIED_OBLIGATIONMsg=This method may fail to clean up (close, dispose of) a stream, database object, or other resource requiring an explicit cleanup operation. In general, if a method opens a stream or other resource, the method should use a try/finally block to ensure that the stream or resource is cleaned up before the method returns.

#OBL: Method may fail to clean up stream or resource on checked exception (OBL_UNSATISFIED_OBLIGATION_EXCEPTION_EDGE)
OBL_UNSATISFIED_OBLIGATION_EXCEPTION_EDGE=;SFP-14;CWE-459
OBL_UNSATISFIED_OBLIGATION_EXCEPTION_EDGEMsg=This method may fail to clean up (close, dispose of) a stream, database object, or other resource requiring an explicit cleanup operation.

#Dm: Consider using Locale parameterized version of invoked method (DM_CONVERT_CASE)
DM_CONVERT_CASE=;SFP--1;CWE-710
DM_CONVERT_CASEMsg=A String is being converted to upper or lowercase, using the platform's default encoding. This may result in improper conversions when used with international characters.

#Dm: Reliance on default encoding (DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING)
DM_DEFAULT_ENCODING=;SFP-24;CWE-172
DM_DEFAULT_ENCODINGMsg=Found a call to a method which will perform a byte to String (or String to byte) conversion, and will assume that the default platform encoding is suitable. This will cause the application behaviour to vary between platforms. Use an alternative API and specify a charset name or Charset object explicitly.

#DP: Classloaders should only be created inside doPrivileged block (DP_CREATE_CLASSLOADER_INSIDE_DO_PRIVILEGED)
DP_CREATE_CLASSLOADER_INSIDE_DO_PRIVILEGED=;SFP-27;CWE-545
DP_CREATE_CLASSLOADER_INSIDE_DO_PRIVILEGEDMsg=This code creates a classloader, which requires a security manager. If this code will be granted security permissions, but might be invoked by code that does not have security permissions, then the classloader creation needs to occur inside a doPrivileged block.

#DP: Method invoked that should be only be invoked inside a doPrivileged block (DP_DO_INSIDE_DO_PRIVILEGED)
DP_DO_INSIDE_DO_PRIVILEGED=;SFP--1;CWE-250
DP_DO_INSIDE_DO_PRIVILEGEDMsg=This code invokes a method that requires a security permission check. If this code will be granted security permissions, but might be invoked by code that does not have security permissions, then the invocation needs to occur inside a doPrivileged block.

#EI: May expose internal representation by returning reference to mutable object (EI_EXPOSE_REP)
EI_EXPOSE_REP=;SFP-23;CWE-375
EI_EXPOSE_REPMsg=Returning a reference to a mutable object value stored in one of the object's fields exposes the internal representation of the object.  If instances are accessed by untrusted code, and unchecked changes to the mutable object would compromise security or other important properties, you will need to do something different. Returning a new copy of the object is better approach in many situations.

#FI: Finalizer should be protected, not public (FI_PUBLIC_SHOULD_BE_PROTECTED)
FI_PUBLIC_SHOULD_BE_PROTECTED=;SFP-28;CWE-583
FI_PUBLIC_SHOULD_BE_PROTECTEDMsg=A class's finalize() method should have protected access, not public.

#MS: May expose internal static state by storing a mutable object into a static field (EI_EXPOSE_STATIC_REP2)
EI_EXPOSE_STATIC_REP2=;SFP-23;CWE-607
EI_EXPOSE_STATIC_REP2Msg=This code stores a reference to an externally mutable object into a static field. If unchecked changes to the mutable object would compromise security or other important properties, you will need to do something different. Storing a copy of the object is better approach in many situations.

#MS: Field isn't final and can't be protected from malicious code (MS_CANNOT_BE_FINAL)
MS_CANNOT_BE_FINAL=;SFP-28;CWE-500
MS_CANNOT_BE_FINALMsg=A mutable static field could be changed by malicious code or by accident from another package. Unfortunately, the way the field is used doesn't allow any easy fix to this problem.

#MS: Public static method may expose internal representation by returning array (MS_EXPOSE_REP)
MS_EXPOSE_REP=;SFP-23;CWE-495
MS_EXPOSE_REPMsg=A public static method returns a reference to an array that is part of the static state of the class. Any code that calls this method can freely modify the underlying array. One fix is to return a copy of the array.

#MS: Field should be both final and package protected (MS_FINAL_PKGPROTECT)
MS_FINAL_PKGPROTECT=;SFP-28;CWE-500
MS_FINAL_PKGPROTECTMsg=A mutable static field could be changed by malicious code or by accident from another package. The field could be made package protected and/or made final to avoid this vulnerability.

#MS: Field is a mutable array (MS_MUTABLE_ARRAY)
MS_MUTABLE_ARRAY=;SFP-23;CWE-607
MS_MUTABLE_ARRAYMsg=A final static field references an array and can be accessed by malicious code or by accident from another package. This code can freely modify the contents of the array.

#MS: Field is a mutable collection (MS_MUTABLE_COLLECTION)
MS_MUTABLE_COLLECTION=;SFP-28;CWE-582
MS_MUTABLE_COLLECTIONMsg=A mutable collection instance is assigned to a final static field, thus can be changed by malicious code or by accident from another package. Consider wrapping this field into Collections.unmodifiableSet/List/Map/etc. to avoid this vulnerability.

#MS: Field is a mutable collection which should be package protected (MS_MUTABLE_COLLECTION_PKGPROTECT)
MS_MUTABLE_COLLECTION_PKGPROTECT=;SFP-28;CWE-582
MS_MUTABLE_COLLECTION_PKGPROTECTMsg=A mutable collection instance is assigned to a final static field, thus can be changed by malicious code or by accident from another package. The field could be made package protected to avoid this vulnerability. Alternatively you may wrap this field into Collections.unmodifiableSet/List/Map/etc. to avoid this vulnerability.

#MS: Field is a mutable Hashtable (MS_MUTABLE_HASHTABLE)
MS_MUTABLE_HASHTABLE=;SFP-23;CWE-607
MS_MUTABLE_HASHTABLEMsg=A final static field references a Hashtable and can be accessed by malicious code or by accident from another package. This code can freely modify the contents of the Hashtable.

#MS: Field should be moved out of an interface and made package protected (MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT)
MS_OOI_PKGPROTECT=;SFP-23;CWE-607
MS_OOI_PKGPROTECTMsg=A final static field that is defined in an interface references a mutable object such as an array or hashtable. This mutable object could be changed by malicious code or by accident from another package. To solve this, the field needs to be moved to a class and made package protected to avoid this vulnerability.

#MS: Field should be package protected (MS_PKGPROTECT)
MS_PKGPROTECT=;SFP-23;CWE-607
MS_PKGPROTECTMsg=A mutable static field could be changed by malicious code or by accident. The field could be made package protected to avoid this vulnerability.

#MS: Field isn't final but should be (MS_SHOULD_BE_FINAL)
MS_SHOULD_BE_FINAL=;SFP-28;CWE-500
MS_SHOULD_BE_FINALMsg=A mutable static field could be changed by malicious code or by accident from another package. The field could be made final to avoid this vulnerability.

#MS: Field isn't final but should be refactored to be so (MS_SHOULD_BE_REFACTORED_TO_BE_FINAL)
MS_SHOULD_BE_REFACTORED_TO_BE_FINAL=;SFP-28;CWE-500
MS_SHOULD_BE_REFACTORED_TO_BE_FINALMsg=This static field public but not final, and could be changed by malicious code or by accident from another package. The field could be made final to avoid this vulnerability. However, the static initializer contains more than one write to the field, so doing so will require some refactoring.

#AT: Sequence of calls to concurrent abstraction may not be atomic (AT_OPERATION_SEQUENCE_ON_CONCURRENT_ABSTRACTION)
AT_OPERATION_SEQUENCE_ON_CONCURRENT_ABSTRACTION=;SFP--1;CWE-710
AT_OPERATION_SEQUENCE_ON_CONCURRENT_ABSTRACTIONMsg=This code contains a sequence of calls to a concurrent abstraction (such as a concurrent hash map). These calls will not be executed atomically.

#DC: Possible double check of field (DC_DOUBLECHECK)
DC_DOUBLECHECK=;SFP-19;CWE-609
DC_DOUBLECHECKMsg=This method may contain an instance of double-checked locking.  This idiom is not correct according to the semantics of the Java memory model.  For more information, see the web page http://www.cs.umd.edu/~pugh/java/memoryModel/DoubleCheckedLocking.html.

#DC: Possible exposure of partially initialized object (DC_PARTIALLY_CONSTRUCTED)
DC_PARTIALLY_CONSTRUCTED=;SFP--1;CWE--1
DC_PARTIALLY_CONSTRUCTEDMsg=This code contains a sequence of calls to a concurrent abstraction (such as a concurrent hash map). These calls will not be executed atomically.

#DL: Synchronization on Boolean (DL_SYNCHRONIZATION_ON_BOOLEAN)
DL_SYNCHRONIZATION_ON_BOOLEAN=;SFP-19;CWE-833
DL_SYNCHRONIZATION_ON_BOOLEANMsg=The code synchronizes on a boxed primitive constant, such as an Boolean. Since there normally exist only two Boolean objects, this code could be synchronizing on the same object as other, unrelated code, leading to unresponsiveness and possible deadlock

#DL: Synchronization on boxed primitive (DL_SYNCHRONIZATION_ON_BOXED_PRIMITIVE)
DL_SYNCHRONIZATION_ON_BOXED_PRIMITIVE=;SFP-19;CWE-833
DL_SYNCHRONIZATION_ON_BOXED_PRIMITIVEMsg=The code synchronizes on a boxed primitive constant, such as an Integer. Since Integer objects can be cached and shared, this code could be synchronizing on the same object as other, unrelated code, leading to unresponsiveness and possible deadlock

#DL: Synchronization on interned String (DL_SYNCHRONIZATION_ON_SHARED_CONSTANT)
DL_SYNCHRONIZATION_ON_SHARED_CONSTANT=;SFP-19;CWE-833
DL_SYNCHRONIZATION_ON_SHARED_CONSTANTMsg=The code synchronizes on interned String. Constant Strings are interned and shared across all other classes loaded by the JVM. Thus, this could is locking on something that other code might also be locking. This could result in very strange and hard to diagnose blocking and deadlock behavior. See http://www.javalobby.org/java/forums/t96352.html and http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/JETTY-352.

#DL: Synchronization on boxed primitive values (DL_SYNCHRONIZATION_ON_UNSHARED_BOXED_PRIMITIVE)
DL_SYNCHRONIZATION_ON_UNSHARED_BOXED_PRIMITIVE=;SFP-19;CWE-833
DL_SYNCHRONIZATION_ON_UNSHARED_BOXED_PRIMITIVEMsg=The code synchronizes on an apparently unshared boxed primitive, such as an Integer. It would be much better, in this code, to redeclare fileLock as

#Dm: Monitor wait() called on Condition (DM_MONITOR_WAIT_ON_CONDITION)
DM_MONITOR_WAIT_ON_CONDITION=;SFP--1;CWE-710
DM_MONITOR_WAIT_ON_CONDITIONMsg=This method calls wait() on a java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition object.  Waiting for a Condition should be done using one of the await() methods defined by the Condition interface.

#Dm: A thread was created using the default empty run method (DM_USELESS_THREAD)
DM_USELESS_THREAD=;SFP--1;CWE-710
DM_USELESS_THREADMsg=This method creates a thread without specifying a run method either by deriving from the Thread class, or by passing a Runnable object. This thread, then, does nothing but waste time.

#ESync: Empty synchronized block (ESync_EMPTY_SYNC)
ESync_EMPTY_SYNC=;SFP-21;CWE-585
ESync_EMPTY_SYNCMsg=The code contains an empty synchronized block

#IS: Inconsistent synchronization (IS2_INCONSISTENT_SYNC)
IS2_INCONSISTENT_SYNC=;SFP-19;CWE-662
IS2_INCONSISTENT_SYNCMsg=The fields of this class appear to be accessed inconsistently with respect to synchronization.

#IS: Field not guarded against concurrent access (IS_FIELD_NOT_GUARDED)
IS_FIELD_NOT_GUARDED=;SFP-19;CWE-413
IS_FIELD_NOT_GUARDEDMsg=This field is annotated with net.jcip.annotations.GuardedBy, but can be accessed in a way that seems to violate the annotation.

#JLM: Synchronization performed on Lock (JLM_JSR166_LOCK_MONITORENTER)
JLM_JSR166_LOCK_MONITORENTER=;SFP--1;CWE-710
JLM_JSR166_LOCK_MONITORENTERMsg=This method performs synchronization an object that implements java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock. Such an object is locked/unlocked using acquire()/release() rather than using the synchronized (...) construct.

#JLM: Synchronization performed on util.concurrent instance (JLM_JSR166_UTILCONCURRENT_MONITORENTER)
JLM_JSR166_UTILCONCURRENT_MONITORENTER=;SFP--1;CWE-710
JLM_JSR166_UTILCONCURRENT_MONITORENTERMsg=This method performs synchronization an object that is an instance of a class from the java.util.concurrent package (or its subclasses). Instances of these classes have their own concurrency control mechanisms that are orthogonal to the synchronization provided by the Java keyword synchronized. For example, synchronizing on an AtomicBoolean will not prevent other threads from modifying the AtomicBoolean.

#JLM: Using monitor style wait methods on util.concurrent abstraction (JML_JSR166_CALLING_WAIT_RATHER_THAN_AWAIT)
JML_JSR166_CALLING_WAIT_RATHER_THAN_AWAIT=;SFP--1;CWE-710
JML_JSR166_CALLING_WAIT_RATHER_THAN_AWAITMsg=This method calls wait(), notify() or notifyAll()() on an object that also provides an await(), signal(), signalAll() method (such as util.concurrent Condition objects). This probably isn't what you want, and even if you do want it, you should consider changing your design, as other developers will find it exceptionally confusing.

#LI: Incorrect lazy initialization of static field (LI_LAZY_INIT_STATIC)
LI_LAZY_INIT_STATIC=;SFP-19;CWE-667
LI_LAZY_INIT_STATICMsg=This method contains an unsynchronized lazy initialization of a non-volatile static field. Because the compiler or processor may reorder instructions, threads are not guaranteed to see a completely initialized object, if the method can be called by multiple threads. You can make the field volatile to correct the problem. For more information, see the Java Memory Model web site.

#LI: Incorrect lazy initialization and update of static field (LI_LAZY_INIT_UPDATE_STATIC)
LI_LAZY_INIT_UPDATE_STATIC=;SFP-19;CWE-667
LI_LAZY_INIT_UPDATE_STATICMsg=This method contains an unsynchronized lazy initialization of a static field. After the field is set, the object stored into that location is further updated or accessed. The setting of the field is visible to other threads as soon as it is set. If the futher accesses in the method that set the field serve to initialize the object, then you have a very serious multithreading bug, unless something else prevents any other thread from accessing the stored object until it is fully initialized. Even if you feel confident that the method is never called by multiple threads, it might be better to not set the static field until the value you are setting it to is fully populated/initialized.

#ML: Synchronization on field in futile attempt to guard that field (ML_SYNC_ON_FIELD_TO_GUARD_CHANGING_THAT_FIELD)
ML_SYNC_ON_FIELD_TO_GUARD_CHANGING_THAT_FIELD=;SFP-19;CWE-667
ML_SYNC_ON_FIELD_TO_GUARD_CHANGING_THAT_FIELDMsg=This method synchronizes on a field in what appears to be an attempt to guard against simultaneous updates to that field. But guarding a field gets a lock on the referenced object, not on the field. This may not provide the mutual exclusion you need, and other threads might be obtaining locks on the referenced objects (for other purposes).

#ML: Method synchronizes on an updated field (ML_SYNC_ON_UPDATED_FIELD)
ML_SYNC_ON_UPDATED_FIELD=;SFP-19;CWE-667
ML_SYNC_ON_UPDATED_FIELDMsg=This method synchronizes on an object referenced from a mutable field. This is unlikely to have useful semantics, since different threads may be synchronizing on different objects.

#MSF: Mutable servlet field (MSF_MUTABLE_SERVLET_FIELD)
MSF_MUTABLE_SERVLET_FIELD=;SFP-19;CWE-667
MSF_MUTABLE_SERVLET_FIELDMsg=A web server generally only creates one instance of servlet or jsp class (i.e., treats the class as a Singleton), and will have multiple threads invoke methods on that instance to service multiple simultaneous requests. Thus, having a mutable instance field generally creates race conditions.

#MWN: Mismatched notify() (MWN_MISMATCHED_NOTIFY)
MWN_MISMATCHED_NOTIFY=;SFP-19;CWE-667
MWN_MISMATCHED_NOTIFYMsg=This method calls Object.notify() or Object.notifyAll() without obviously holding a lock on the object.  Calling notify() or notifyAll() without a lock held will result in an IllegalMonitorStateException being thrown.

#MWN: Mismatched wait() (MWN_MISMATCHED_WAIT)
MWN_MISMATCHED_WAIT=;SFP-19;CWE-667
MWN_MISMATCHED_WAITMsg=This method calls Object.wait() without obviously holding a lock on the object.  Calling wait() without a lock held will result in an IllegalMonitorStateException being thrown.

#NN: Naked notify (NN_NAKED_NOTIFY)
NN_NAKED_NOTIFY=;SFP--1;CWE-398
NN_NAKED_NOTIFYMsg=A call to notify() or notifyAll() was made without any (apparent) accompanying modification to mutable object state.  In general, calling a notify method on a monitor is done because some condition another thread is waiting for has become true.  However, for the condition to be meaningful, it must involve a heap object that is visible to both threads. This bug does not necessarily indicate an error, since the change to mutable object state may have taken place in a method which then called the method containing the notification.

#NP: Synchronize and null check on the same field. (NP_SYNC_AND_NULL_CHECK_FIELD)
NP_SYNC_AND_NULL_CHECK_FIELD=;SFP-7;CWE-476
NP_SYNC_AND_NULL_CHECK_FIELDMsg=Since the field is synchronized on, it seems not likely to be null. If it is null and then synchronized on a NullPointerException will be thrown and the check would be pointless. Better to synchronize on another field.

#No: Using notify() rather than notifyAll() (NO_NOTIFY_NOT_NOTIFYALL)
NO_NOTIFY_NOT_NOTIFYALL=;SFP--1;CWE-701
NO_NOTIFY_NOT_NOTIFYALLMsg=This method calls notify() rather than notifyAll().  Java monitors are often used for multiple conditions.  Calling notify() only wakes up one thread, meaning that the thread woken up might not be the one waiting for the condition that the caller just satisfied.

#RS: Class's readObject() method is synchronized (RS_READOBJECT_SYNC)
RS_READOBJECT_SYNC=;SFP--1;CWE-398
RS_READOBJECT_SYNCMsg=This serializable class defines a readObject() which is synchronized.  By definition, an object created by deserialization is only reachable by one thread, and thus there is no need for readObject() to be synchronized.  If the readObject() method itself is causing the object to become visible to another thread, that is an example of very dubious coding style.

#RV: Return value of putIfAbsent ignored, value passed to putIfAbsent reused (RV_RETURN_VALUE_OF_PUTIFABSENT_IGNORED)
RV_RETURN_VALUE_OF_PUTIFABSENT_IGNORED=;SFP-4;CWE-252
RV_RETURN_VALUE_OF_PUTIFABSENT_IGNOREDMsg=The putIfAbsent method is typically used to ensure that a single value is associated with a given key (the first value for which put if absent succeeds). If you ignore the return value and retain a reference to the value passed in, you run the risk of retaining a value that is not the one that is associated with the key in the map. If it matters which one you use and you use the one that isn't stored in the map, your program will behave incorrectly.

#Ru: Invokes run on a thread (did you mean to start it instead?) (RU_INVOKE_RUN)
RU_INVOKE_RUN=;SFP-3;CWE-572
RU_INVOKE_RUNMsg=This method explicitly invokes run() on an object.  In general, classes implement the Runnable interface because they are going to have their run() method invoked in a new thread, in which case Thread.start() is the right method to call.

#SC: Constructor invokes Thread.start() (SC_START_IN_CTOR)
SC_START_IN_CTOR=;SFP--1;CWE-398
SC_START_IN_CTORMsg=The constructor starts a thread. This is likely to be wrong if the class is ever extended/subclassed, since the thread will be started before the subclass constructor is started.

#SP: Method spins on field (SP_SPIN_ON_FIELD)
SP_SPIN_ON_FIELD=;SFP-19;CWE-667
SP_SPIN_ON_FIELDMsg=This method spins in a loop which reads a field.  The compiler may legally hoist the read out of the loop, turning the code into an infinite loop.  The class should be changed so it uses proper synchronization (including wait and notify calls).

#STCAL: Call to static Calendar (STCAL_INVOKE_ON_STATIC_CALENDAR_INSTANCE)
STCAL_INVOKE_ON_STATIC_CALENDAR_INSTANCE=;SFP-19;CWE-667
STCAL_INVOKE_ON_STATIC_CALENDAR_INSTANCEMsg=Even though the JavaDoc does not contain a hint about it, Calendars are inherently unsafe for multihtreaded use. The detector has found a call to an instance of Calendar that has been obtained via a static field. This looks suspicous. For more information on this see Sun Bug #6231579 and Sun Bug #6178997.

#STCAL: Call to static DateFormat (STCAL_INVOKE_ON_STATIC_DATE_FORMAT_INSTANCE)
STCAL_INVOKE_ON_STATIC_DATE_FORMAT_INSTANCE=;SFP-19;CWE-667
STCAL_INVOKE_ON_STATIC_DATE_FORMAT_INSTANCEMsg=As the JavaDoc states, DateFormats are inherently unsafe for multithreaded use. The detector has found a call to an instance of DateFormat that has been obtained via a static field. This looks suspicous. For more information on this see Sun Bug #6231579 and Sun Bug #6178997.

#STCAL: Static Calendar field (STCAL_STATIC_CALENDAR_INSTANCE)
STCAL_STATIC_CALENDAR_INSTANCE=;SFP-19;CWE-667
STCAL_STATIC_CALENDAR_INSTANCEMsg=Even though the JavaDoc does not contain a hint about it, Calendars are inherently unsafe for multihtreaded use. Sharing a single instance across thread boundaries without proper synchronization will result in erratic behavior of the application. Under 1.4 problems seem to surface less often than under Java 5 where you will probably see random ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsExceptions or IndexOutOfBoundsExceptions in sun.util.calendar.BaseCalendar.getCalendarDateFromFixedDate(). You may also experience serialization problems. Using an instance field is recommended. For more information on this see Sun Bug #6231579 and Sun Bug #6178997.

#STCAL: Static DateFormat (STCAL_STATIC_SIMPLE_DATE_FORMAT_INSTANCE)
STCAL_STATIC_SIMPLE_DATE_FORMAT_INSTANCE=;SFP-19;CWE-667
STCAL_STATIC_SIMPLE_DATE_FORMAT_INSTANCEMsg=As the JavaDoc states, DateFormats are inherently unsafe for multithreaded use. Sharing a single instance across thread boundaries without proper synchronization will result in erratic behavior of the application. You may also experience serialization problems. Using an instance field is recommended. For more information on this see Sun Bug #6231579 and Sun Bug #6178997.

#SWL: Method calls Thread.sleep() with a lock held (SWL_SLEEP_WITH_LOCK_HELD)
SWL_SLEEP_WITH_LOCK_HELD=;SFP-19;CWE-667
SWL_SLEEP_WITH_LOCK_HELDMsg=This method calls Thread.sleep() with a lock held. This may result in very poor performance and scalability, or a deadlock, since other threads may be waiting to acquire the lock. It is a much better idea to call wait() on the lock, which releases the lock and allows other threads to run.

#TLW: Wait with two locks held (TLW_TWO_LOCK_WAIT)
TLW_TWO_LOCK_WAIT=;SFP-19;CWE-833
TLW_TWO_LOCK_WAITMsg=Waiting on a monitor while two locks are held may cause deadlock.   Performing a wait only releases the lock on the object being waited on, not any other locks.   This not necessarily a bug, but is worth examining closely.

#UG: Unsynchronized get method, synchronized set method (UG_SYNC_SET_UNSYNC_GET)
UG_SYNC_SET_UNSYNC_GET=;SFP-19;CWE-667
UG_SYNC_SET_UNSYNC_GETMsg=This class contains similarly-named get and set methods where the set method is synchronized and the get method is not.  This may result in incorrect behavior at runtime, as callers of the get method will not necessarily see a consistent state for the object.  The get method should be made synchronized.

#UL: Method does not release lock on all paths (UL_UNRELEASED_LOCK)
UL_UNRELEASED_LOCK=;SFP-19;CWE-667
UL_UNRELEASED_LOCKMsg=This method acquires a JSR-166 (java.util.concurrent) lock, but does not release it on all paths out of the method.

#UL: Method does not release lock on all exception paths (UL_UNRELEASED_LOCK_EXCEPTION_PATH)
UL_UNRELEASED_LOCK_EXCEPTION_PATH=;SFP-19;CWE-667
UL_UNRELEASED_LOCK_EXCEPTION_PATHMsg=This method acquires a JSR-166 (java.util.concurrent) lock, but does not release it on all exception paths out of the method.

#UW: Unconditional wait (UW_UNCOND_WAIT)
UW_UNCOND_WAIT=;SFP--1;CWE-398
UW_UNCOND_WAITMsg=This method contains a call to java.lang.Object.wait() which is not guarded by conditional control flow.  The code should verify that condition it intends to wait for is not already satisfied before calling wait; any previous notifications will be ignored.

#VO: An increment to a volatile field isn't atomic (VO_VOLATILE_INCREMENT)
VO_VOLATILE_INCREMENT=;SFP--1;CWE-398
VO_VOLATILE_INCREMENTMsg=This code increments a volatile field. Increments of volatile fields aren't atomic. If more than one thread is incrementing the field at the same time, increments could be lost.

#VO: A volatile reference to an array doesn't treat the array elements as volatile (VO_VOLATILE_REFERENCE_TO_ARRAY)
VO_VOLATILE_REFERENCE_TO_ARRAY=;SFP--1;CWE-398
VO_VOLATILE_REFERENCE_TO_ARRAYMsg=This declares a volatile reference to an array, which might not be what you want. With a volatile reference to an array, reads and writes of the reference to the array are treated as volatile, but the array elements are non-volatile. To get volatile array elements, you will need to use one of the atomic array classes in java.util.concurrent (provided in Java 5.0).

#WL: Synchronization on getClass rather than class literal (WL_USING_GETCLASS_RATHER_THAN_CLASS_LITERAL)
WL_USING_GETCLASS_RATHER_THAN_CLASS_LITERAL=;SFP-19;CWE-398
WL_USING_GETCLASS_RATHER_THAN_CLASS_LITERALMsg=This instance method synchronizes on this.getClass(). If this class is subclassed, subclasses will synchronize on the class object for the subclass, which isn't likely what was intended.

#WS: Class's writeObject() method is synchronized but nothing else is (WS_WRITEOBJECT_SYNC)
WS_WRITEOBJECT_SYNC=;SFP-19;CWE-667
WS_WRITEOBJECT_SYNCMsg=This class has a writeObject() method which is synchronized; however, no other method of the class is synchronized.

#Wa: Condition.await() not in loop (WA_AWAIT_NOT_IN_LOOP)
WA_AWAIT_NOT_IN_LOOP=;SFP--1;CWE-398
WA_AWAIT_NOT_IN_LOOPMsg=This method contains a call to java.util.concurrent.await() (or variants) which is not in a loop.  If the object is used for multiple conditions, the condition the caller intended to wait for might not be the one that actually occurred.

#Wa: Wait not in loop (WA_NOT_IN_LOOP)
WA_NOT_IN_LOOP=;SFP--1;CWE-398
WA_NOT_IN_LOOPMsg=This method contains a call to java.lang.Object.wait() which is not in a loop.  If the monitor is used for multiple conditions, the condition the caller intended to wait for might not be the one that actually occurred.

#Bx: Primitive value is boxed and then immediately unboxed (BX_BOXING_IMMEDIATELY_UNBOXED)
BX_BOXING_IMMEDIATELY_UNBOXED=;SFP--1;CWE-710
BX_BOXING_IMMEDIATELY_UNBOXEDMsg=A primitive is boxed, and then immediately unboxed. This probably is due to a manual boxing in a place where an unboxed value is required, thus forcing the compiler to immediately undo the work of the boxing.

#Bx: Primitive value is boxed then unboxed to perform primitive coercion (BX_BOXING_IMMEDIATELY_UNBOXED_TO_PERFORM_COERCION)
BX_BOXING_IMMEDIATELY_UNBOXED_TO_PERFORM_COERCION=;SFP--1;CWE-710
BX_BOXING_IMMEDIATELY_UNBOXED_TO_PERFORM_COERCIONMsg=A primitive boxed value constructed and then immediately converted into a different primitive type (e.g., new Double(d).intValue()). Just perform direct primitive coercion (e.g., (int) d).

#Bx: Primitive value is unboxed and coerced for ternary operator (BX_UNBOXED_AND_COERCED_FOR_TERNARY_OPERATOR)
BX_UNBOXED_AND_COERCED_FOR_TERNARY_OPERATOR=;SFP--1;CWE-192
BX_UNBOXED_AND_COERCED_FOR_TERNARY_OPERATORMsg=A wrapped primitive value is unboxed and converted to another primitive type as part of the evaluation of a conditional ternary operator (the b ? e1 : e2 operator). The semantics of Java mandate that if e1 and e2 are wrapped numeric values, the values are unboxed and converted/coerced to their common type (e.g, if e1 is of type Integer and e2 is of type Float, then e1 is unboxed, converted to a floating point value, and boxed. See JLS Section 15.25.

#Bx: Boxed value is unboxed and then immediately reboxed (BX_UNBOXING_IMMEDIATELY_REBOXED)
BX_UNBOXING_IMMEDIATELY_REBOXED=;SFP--1;CWE-398
BX_UNBOXING_IMMEDIATELY_REBOXEDMsg=A boxed value is unboxed and then immediately reboxed.

#Bx: Boxing a primitive to compare (DM_BOXED_PRIMITIVE_FOR_COMPARE)
DM_BOXED_PRIMITIVE_FOR_COMPARE=;SFP--1;CWE-398
DM_BOXED_PRIMITIVE_FOR_COMPAREMsg=A boxed primitive is created just to call compareTo method. It's more efficient to use static compare method (for double and float since Java 1.4, for other primitive types since Java 1.7) which works on primitives directly.

#Bx: Boxing/unboxing to parse a primitive (DM_BOXED_PRIMITIVE_FOR_PARSING)
DM_BOXED_PRIMITIVE_FOR_PARSING=;SFP--1;CWE-398
DM_BOXED_PRIMITIVE_FOR_PARSINGMsg=A boxed primitive is created from a String, just to extract the unboxed primitive value. It is more efficient to just call the static parseXXX method.

#Bx: Method allocates a boxed primitive just to call toString (DM_BOXED_PRIMITIVE_TOSTRING)
DM_BOXED_PRIMITIVE_TOSTRING=;SFP--1;CWE-710
DM_BOXED_PRIMITIVE_TOSTRINGMsg=A boxed primitive is allocated just to call toString(). It is more effective to just use the static form of toString which takes the primitive value.

#Bx: Method invokes inefficient floating-point Number constructor; use static valueOf instead (DM_FP_NUMBER_CTOR)
DM_FP_NUMBER_CTOR=;SFP--1;CWE-398
DM_FP_NUMBER_CTORMsg=Using new Double(double) is guaranteed to always result in a new object whereas Double.valueOf(double) allows caching of values to be done by the compiler, class library, or JVM. Using of cached values avoids object allocation and the code will be faster. Unless the class must be compatible with JVMs predating Java 1.5, use either autoboxing or the valueOf() method when creating instances of Double and Float.

#Bx: Method invokes inefficient Number constructor; use static valueOf instead (DM_NUMBER_CTOR)
DM_NUMBER_CTOR=;SFP--1;CWE-398
DM_NUMBER_CTORMsg=Using new Integer(int) is guaranteed to always result in a new object whereas Integer.valueOf(int) allows caching of values to be done by the compiler, class library, or JVM. Using of cached values avoids object allocation and the code will be faster. Values between -128 and 127 are guaranteed to have corresponding cached instances and using valueOf is approximately 3.5 times faster than using constructor. For values outside the constant range the performance of both styles is the same. Unless the class must be compatible with JVMs predating Java 1.5, use either autoboxing or the valueOf() method when creating instances of Long, Integer, Short, Character, and Byte.

#Dm: The equals and hashCode methods of URL are blocking (DMI_BLOCKING_METHODS_ON_URL)
DMI_BLOCKING_METHODS_ON_URL=;SFP--1;CWE-398
DMI_BLOCKING_METHODS_ON_URLMsg=The equals and hashCode method of URL perform domain name resolution, this can result in a big performance hit. See http://michaelscharf.blogspot.com/2006/11/javaneturlequals-and-hashcode-make.html for more information. Consider using java.net.URI instead.

#Dm: Maps and sets of URLs can be performance hogs (DMI_COLLECTION_OF_URLS)
DMI_COLLECTION_OF_URLS=;SFP--1;CWE-398
DMI_COLLECTION_OF_URLSMsg=This method or field is or uses a Map or Set of URLs. Since both the equals and hashCode method of URL perform domain name resolution, this can result in a big performance hit. See http://michaelscharf.blogspot.com/2006/11/javaneturlequals-and-hashcode-make.html for more information. Consider using java.net.URI instead.

#Dm: Method invokes inefficient Boolean constructor; use Boolean.valueOf(...) instead (DM_BOOLEAN_CTOR)
DM_BOOLEAN_CTOR=;SFP--1;CWE-398
DM_BOOLEAN_CTORMsg=Creating new instances of java.lang.Boolean wastes memory, since Boolean objects are immutable and there are only two useful values of this type.  Use the Boolean.valueOf() method (or Java 1.5 autoboxing) to create Boolean objects instead.

#Dm: Explicit garbage collection; extremely dubious except in benchmarking code (DM_GC)
DM_GC=;SFP--1;CWE-710
DM_GCMsg=Code explicitly invokes garbage collection. Except for specific use in benchmarking, this is very dubious. In the past, situations where people have explicitly invoked the garbage collector in routines such as close or finalize methods has led to huge performance black holes. Garbage collection can be expensive. Any situation that forces hundreds or thousands of garbage collections will bring the machine to a crawl.

#Dm: Method allocates an object, only to get the class object (DM_NEW_FOR_GETCLASS)
DM_NEW_FOR_GETCLASS=;SFP--1;CWE-398
DM_NEW_FOR_GETCLASSMsg=This method allocates an object just to call getClass() on it, in order to retrieve the Class object for it. It is simpler to just access the .class property of the class.

#Dm: Use the nextInt method of Random rather than nextDouble to generate a random integer (DM_NEXTINT_VIA_NEXTDOUBLE)
DM_NEXTINT_VIA_NEXTDOUBLE=;SFP--1;CWE-710
DM_NEXTINT_VIA_NEXTDOUBLEMsg=If r is a java.util.Random, you can generate a random number from 0 to n-1 using r.nextInt(n), rather than using (int)(r.nextDouble() * n).

#Dm: Method invokes inefficient new String(String) constructor (DM_STRING_CTOR)
DM_STRING_CTOR=;SFP--1;CWE-398
DM_STRING_CTORMsg=Using the java.lang.String(String) constructor wastes memory because the object so constructed will be functionally indistinguishable from the String passed as a parameter.  Just use the argument String directly.

#Dm: Method invokes toString() method on a String (DM_STRING_TOSTRING)
DM_STRING_TOSTRING=;SFP--1;CWE-710
DM_STRING_TOSTRINGMsg=Calling String.toString() is just a redundant operation. Just use the String.

#Dm: Method invokes inefficient new String() constructor (DM_STRING_VOID_CTOR)
DM_STRING_VOID_CTOR=;SFP--1;CWE-398
DM_STRING_VOID_CTORMsg=Creating a new java.lang.String object using the no-argument constructor wastes memory because the object so created will be functionally indistinguishable from the empty string constant "".  Java guarantees that identical string constants will be represented by the same String object.  Therefore, you should just use the empty string constant directly.

#HSC: Huge string constants is duplicated across multiple class files (HSC_HUGE_SHARED_STRING_CONSTANT)
HSC_HUGE_SHARED_STRING_CONSTANT=;SFP--1;CWE-398
HSC_HUGE_SHARED_STRING_CONSTANTMsg=A large String constant is duplicated across multiple class files. This is likely because a final field is initialized to a String constant, and the Java language mandates that all references to a final field from other classes be inlined into that classfile. See JDK bug 6447475 for a description of an occurrence of this bug in the JDK and how resolving it reduced the size of the JDK by 1 megabyte.

#SBSC: Method concatenates strings using + in a loop (SBSC_USE_STRINGBUFFER_CONCATENATION)
SBSC_USE_STRINGBUFFER_CONCATENATION=;SFP--1;CWE-398
SBSC_USE_STRINGBUFFER_CONCATENATIONMsg=The method seems to be building a String using concatenation in a loop. In each iteration, the String is converted to a StringBuffer/StringBuilder, appended to, and converted back to a String. This can lead to a cost quadratic in the number of iterations, as the growing string is recopied in each iteration. Better performance can be obtained by using a StringBuffer (or StringBuilder in Java 1.5) explicitly.

#SIC: Should be a static inner class (SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC)
SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC=;SFP--1;CWE-398
SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATICMsg=This class is an inner class, but does not use its embedded reference to the object which created it.  This reference makes the instances of the class larger, and may keep the reference to the creator object alive longer than necessary.  If possible, the class should be made static.

#SIC: Could be refactored into a named static inner class (SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC_ANON)
SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC_ANON=;SFP--1;CWE-398
SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC_ANONMsg=This class is an inner class, but does not use its embedded reference to the object which created it.  This reference makes the instances of the class larger, and may keep the reference to the creator object alive longer than necessary.  If possible, the class should be made into a static inner class. Since anonymous inner classes cannot be marked as static, doing this will require refactoring the inner class so that it is a named inner class.

#SIC: Could be refactored into a static inner class (SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC_NEEDS_THIS)
SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC_NEEDS_THIS=;SFP--1;CWE-398
SIC_INNER_SHOULD_BE_STATIC_NEEDS_THISMsg=This class is an inner class, but does not use its embedded reference to the object which created it except during construction of the inner object.  This reference makes the instances of the class larger, and may keep the reference to the creator object alive longer than necessary.  If possible, the class should be made into a static inner class. Since the reference to the outer object is required during construction of the inner instance, the inner class will need to be refactored so as to pass a reference to the outer instance to the constructor for the inner class.

#SS: Unread field: should this field be static? (SS_SHOULD_BE_STATIC)
SS_SHOULD_BE_STATIC=;SFP--1;CWE-710
SS_SHOULD_BE_STATICMsg=This class contains an instance final field that is initialized to a compile-time static value. Consider making the field static.

#UM: Method calls static Math class method on a constant value (UM_UNNECESSARY_MATH)
UM_UNNECESSARY_MATH=;SFP--1;CWE-710
UM_UNNECESSARY_MATHMsg=This method uses a static method from java.lang.Math on a constant value. This method's result in this case, can be determined statically, and is faster and sometimes more accurate to just use the constant.

#UPM: Private method is never called (UPM_UNCALLED_PRIVATE_METHOD)
UPM_UNCALLED_PRIVATE_METHOD=;SFP-2;CWE-561
UPM_UNCALLED_PRIVATE_METHODMsg=This private method is never called. Although it is possible that the method will be invoked through reflection, it is more likely that the method is never used, and should be removed.

#UrF: Unread field (URF_UNREAD_FIELD)
URF_UNREAD_FIELD=;SFP-2;CWE-563
URF_UNREAD_FIELDMsg=This field is never read.  Consider removing it from the class.

#UuF: Unused field (UUF_UNUSED_FIELD)
UUF_UNUSED_FIELD=;SFP-2;CWE-563
UUF_UNUSED_FIELDMsg=This field is never used.  Consider removing it from the class.

#WMI: Inefficient use of keySet iterator instead of entrySet iterator (WMI_WRONG_MAP_ITERATOR)
WMI_WRONG_MAP_ITERATOR=;SFP--1;CWE-710
WMI_WRONG_MAP_ITERATORMsg=This method accesses the value of a Map entry, using a key that was retrieved from a keySet iterator. It is more efficient to use an iterator on the entrySet of the map, to avoid the Map.get(key) lookup.

#Dm: Hardcoded constant database password (DMI_CONSTANT_DB_PASSWORD)
DMI_CONSTANT_DB_PASSWORD=;SFP-33;CWE-259
DMI_CONSTANT_DB_PASSWORDMsg=This code creates a database connect using a hardcoded, constant password. Anyone with access to either the source code or the compiled code can easily learn the password.

#Dm: Empty database password (DMI_EMPTY_DB_PASSWORD)
DMI_EMPTY_DB_PASSWORD=;SFP-33;CWE-259
DMI_EMPTY_DB_PASSWORDMsg=This code creates a database connect using a blank or empty password. This indicates that the database is not protected by a password.

#HRS: HTTP cookie formed from untrusted input (HRS_REQUEST_PARAMETER_TO_COOKIE)
HRS_REQUEST_PARAMETER_TO_COOKIE=;SFP-24;CWE-20
HRS_REQUEST_PARAMETER_TO_COOKIEMsg=This code constructs an HTTP Cookie using an untrusted HTTP parameter. If this cookie is added to an HTTP response, it will allow a HTTP response splitting vulnerability. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_response_splitting for more information. FindBugs looks only for the most blatant, obvious cases of HTTP response splitting. If FindBugs found any, you almost certainly have more vulnerabilities that FindBugs doesn't report. If you are concerned about HTTP response splitting, you should seriously consider using a commercial static analysis or pen-testing tool.

#HRS: HTTP Response splitting vulnerability (HRS_REQUEST_PARAMETER_TO_HTTP_HEADER)
HRS_REQUEST_PARAMETER_TO_HTTP_HEADER=;SFP-24;CWE-113
HRS_REQUEST_PARAMETER_TO_HTTP_HEADERMsg=This code directly writes an HTTP parameter to an HTTP header, which allows for a HTTP response splitting vulnerability. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_response_splitting for more information. FindBugs looks only for the most blatant, obvious cases of HTTP response splitting. If FindBugs found any, you almost certainly have more vulnerabilities that FindBugs doesn't report. If you are concerned about HTTP response splitting, you should seriously consider using a commercial static analysis or pen-testing tool.

#PT: Absolute path traversal in servlet (PT_ABSOLUTE_PATH_TRAVERSAL)
PT_ABSOLUTE_PATH_TRAVERSAL=;SFP-16;CWE-36
PT_ABSOLUTE_PATH_TRAVERSALMsg=The software uses an HTTP request parameter to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize absolute path sequences such as "/abs/path" that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory.

#PT: Relative path traversal in servlet (PT_RELATIVE_PATH_TRAVERSAL)
PT_RELATIVE_PATH_TRAVERSAL=;SFP-16;CWE-23
PT_RELATIVE_PATH_TRAVERSALMsg=The software uses an HTTP request parameter to construct a pathname that should be within a restricted directory, but it does not properly neutralize sequences such as ".." that can resolve to a location that is outside of that directory. 

#SQL: Nonconstant string passed to execute or addBatch method on an SQL statement (SQL_NONCONSTANT_STRING_PASSED_TO_EXECUTE)
SQL_NONCONSTANT_STRING_PASSED_TO_EXECUTE=;SFP-24;CWE-89
SQL_NONCONSTANT_STRING_PASSED_TO_EXECUTEMsg=The method invokes the execute method on an SQL statement with a String that seems to be dynamically generated. Consider using a prepared statement instead. It is more efficient and less vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

#SQL: A prepared statement is generated from a nonconstant String (SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING)
SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRING=;SFP-24;CWE-89
SQL_PREPARED_STATEMENT_GENERATED_FROM_NONCONSTANT_STRINGMsg=The code creates an SQL prepared statement from a nonconstant String. If unchecked, tainted data from a user is used in building this String, SQL injection could be used to make the prepared statement do something unexpected and undesirable.

#XSS: JSP reflected cross site scripting vulnerability (XSS_REQUEST_PARAMETER_TO_JSP_WRITER)
XSS_REQUEST_PARAMETER_TO_JSP_WRITER=;SFP-24;CWE-80
XSS_REQUEST_PARAMETER_TO_JSP_WRITERMsg=This code directly writes an HTTP parameter to JSP output, which allows for a cross site scripting vulnerability. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting for more information. FindBugs looks only for the most blatant, obvious cases of cross site scripting. If FindBugs found any, you almost certainly have more cross site scripting vulnerabilities that FindBugs doesn't report. If you are concerned about cross site scripting, you should seriously consider using a commercial static analysis or pen-testing tool.

#XSS: Servlet reflected cross site scripting vulnerability in error page (XSS_REQUEST_PARAMETER_TO_SEND_ERROR)
XSS_REQUEST_PARAMETER_TO_SEND_ERROR=;SFP-24;CWE-80
XSS_REQUEST_PARAMETER_TO_SEND_ERRORMsg=This code directly writes an HTTP parameter to a Server error page (using HttpServletResponse.sendError). Echoing this untrusted input allows for a reflected cross site scripting vulnerability. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting for more information. FindBugs looks only for the most blatant, obvious cases of cross site scripting. If FindBugs found any, you almost certainly have more cross site scripting vulnerabilities that FindBugs doesn't report. If you are concerned about cross site scripting, you should seriously consider using a commercial static analysis or pen-testing tool.

#XSS: Servlet reflected cross site scripting vulnerability (XSS_REQUEST_PARAMETER_TO_SERVLET_WRITER)
XSS_REQUEST_PARAMETER_TO_SERVLET_WRITER=;SFP-24;CWE-80
XSS_REQUEST_PARAMETER_TO_SERVLET_WRITERMsg=This code directly writes an HTTP parameter to Servlet output, which allows for a reflected cross site scripting vulnerability. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting for more information. FindBugs looks only for the most blatant, obvious cases of cross site scripting. If FindBugs found any, you almost certainly have more cross site scripting vulnerabilities that FindBugs doesn't report. If you are concerned about cross site scripting, you should seriously consider using a commercial static analysis or pen-testing tool.

#BC: Questionable cast to abstract collection (BC_BAD_CAST_TO_ABSTRACT_COLLECTION)
BC_BAD_CAST_TO_ABSTRACT_COLLECTION=;SFP-1;CWE-704
BC_BAD_CAST_TO_ABSTRACT_COLLECTIONMsg=This code casts a Collection to an abstract collection (such as List, Set, or Map). Ensure that you are guaranteed that the object is of the type you are casting to. If all you need is to be able to iterate through a collection, you don't need to cast it to a Set or List.

#BC: Questionable cast to concrete collection (BC_BAD_CAST_TO_CONCRETE_COLLECTION)
BC_BAD_CAST_TO_CONCRETE_COLLECTION=;SFP-1;CWE-704
BC_BAD_CAST_TO_CONCRETE_COLLECTIONMsg=This code casts an abstract collection (such as a Collection, List, or Set) to a specific concrete implementation (such as an ArrayList or HashSet). This might not be correct, and it may make your code fragile, since it makes it harder to switch to other concrete implementations at a future point. Unless you have a particular reason to do so, just use the abstract collection class.

#BC: Unchecked/unconfirmed cast (BC_UNCONFIRMED_CAST)
BC_UNCONFIRMED_CAST=;SFP-1;CWE-704
BC_UNCONFIRMED_CASTMsg=This cast is unchecked, and not all instances of the type casted from can be cast to the type it is being cast to. Check that your program logic ensures that this cast will not fail.

#BC: Unchecked/unconfirmed cast of return value from method (BC_UNCONFIRMED_CAST_OF_RETURN_VALUE)
BC_UNCONFIRMED_CAST_OF_RETURN_VALUE=;SFP--1;CWE-398
BC_UNCONFIRMED_CAST_OF_RETURN_VALUEMsg=This code performs an unchecked cast of the return value of a method. The code might be calling the method in such a way that the cast is guaranteed to be safe, but FindBugs is unable to verify that the cast is safe. Check that your program logic ensures that this cast will not fail.

#BC: instanceof will always return true (BC_VACUOUS_INSTANCEOF)
BC_VACUOUS_INSTANCEOF=;SFP-1;CWE-570
BC_VACUOUS_INSTANCEOFMsg=This instanceof test will always return true (unless the value being tested is null). Although this is safe, make sure it isn't an indication of some misunderstanding or some other logic error. If you really want to test the value for being null, perhaps it would be clearer to do better to do a null test rather than an instanceof test.

#BSHIFT: Unsigned right shift cast to short/byte (ICAST_QUESTIONABLE_UNSIGNED_RIGHT_SHIFT)
ICAST_QUESTIONABLE_UNSIGNED_RIGHT_SHIFT=;SFP-1;CWE-197
ICAST_QUESTIONABLE_UNSIGNED_RIGHT_SHIFTMsg=The code performs an unsigned right shift, whose result is then cast to a short or byte, which discards the upper bits of the result. Since the upper bits are discarded, there may be no difference between a signed and unsigned right shift (depending upon the size of the shift).

#CI: Class is final but declares protected field (CI_CONFUSED_INHERITANCE)
CI_CONFUSED_INHERITANCE=;SFP--1;CWE-710
CI_CONFUSED_INHERITANCEMsg=This class is declared to be final, but declares fields to be protected. Since the class is final, it can not be derived from, and the use of protected is confusing. The access modifier for the field should be changed to private or public to represent the true use for the field.

#DB: Method uses the same code for two branches (DB_DUPLICATE_BRANCHES)
DB_DUPLICATE_BRANCHES=;SFP--1;CWE-398
DB_DUPLICATE_BRANCHESMsg=This method uses the same code to implement two branches of a conditional branch. Check to ensure that this isn't a coding mistake.

#DB: Method uses the same code for two switch clauses (DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES)
DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSES=;SFP--1;CWE-398
DB_DUPLICATE_SWITCH_CLAUSESMsg=This method uses the same code to implement two clauses of a switch statement. This could be a case of duplicate code, but it might also indicate a coding mistake.

#DLS: Dead store to local variable (DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE)
DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE=;SFP--1;CWE-398
DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STOREMsg=This instruction assigns a value to a local variable, but the value is not read or used in any subsequent instruction. Often, this indicates an error, because the value computed is never used. Note that Sun's javac compiler often generates dead stores for final local variables. Because FindBugs is a bytecode-based tool, there is no easy way to eliminate these false positives.

#DLS: Useless assignment in return statement (DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE_IN_RETURN)
DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE_IN_RETURN=;SFP--1;CWE-398
DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE_IN_RETURNMsg=This statement assigns to a local variable in a return statement. This assignment has effect. Please verify that this statement does the right thing.

#DLS: Dead store of null to local variable (DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE_OF_NULL)
DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE_OF_NULL=;SFP--1;CWE-398
DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE_OF_NULLMsg=The code stores null into a local variable, and the stored value is not read. This store may have been introduced to assist the garbage collector, but as of Java SE 6.0, this is no longer needed or useful.

#DLS: Dead store to local variable that shadows field (DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE_SHADOWS_FIELD)
DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE_SHADOWS_FIELD=;SFP-2;CWE-563
DLS_DEAD_LOCAL_STORE_SHADOWS_FIELDMsg=This instruction assigns a value to a local variable, but the value is not read or used in any subsequent instruction. Often, this indicates an error, because the value computed is never used. There is a field with the same name as the local variable. Did you mean to assign to that variable instead?

#DMI: Code contains a hard coded reference to an absolute pathname (DMI_HARDCODED_ABSOLUTE_FILENAME)
DMI_HARDCODED_ABSOLUTE_FILENAME=;SFP--1;CWE-398
DMI_HARDCODED_ABSOLUTE_FILENAMEMsg=This code constructs a File object using a hard coded to an absolute pathname (e.g., new File("/home/dannyc/workspace/j2ee/src/share/com/sun/enterprise/deployment");

#DMI: Non serializable object written to ObjectOutput (DMI_NONSERIALIZABLE_OBJECT_WRITTEN)
DMI_NONSERIALIZABLE_OBJECT_WRITTEN=;SFP-1;CWE-594
DMI_NONSERIALIZABLE_OBJECT_WRITTENMsg=This code seems to be passing a non-serializable object to the ObjectOutput.writeObject method. If the object is, indeed, non-serializable, an error will result.

#DMI: Invocation of substring(0), which returns the original value (DMI_USELESS_SUBSTRING)
DMI_USELESS_SUBSTRING=;SFP--1;CWE-398
DMI_USELESS_SUBSTRINGMsg=This code invokes substring(0) on a String, which returns the original value.

#Dm: Thread passed where Runnable expected (DMI_THREAD_PASSED_WHERE_RUNNABLE_EXPECTED)
DMI_THREAD_PASSED_WHERE_RUNNABLE_EXPECTED=;SFP-1;CWE-686
DMI_THREAD_PASSED_WHERE_RUNNABLE_EXPECTEDMsg=A Thread object is passed as a parameter to a method where a Runnable is expected. This is rather unusual, and may indicate a logic error or cause unexpected behavior.

#Eq: Class doesn't override equals in superclass (EQ_DOESNT_OVERRIDE_EQUALS)
EQ_DOESNT_OVERRIDE_EQUALS=;SFP--1;CWE-389
EQ_DOESNT_OVERRIDE_EQUALSMsg=This class extends a class that defines an equals method and adds fields, but doesn't define an equals method itself. Thus, equality on instances of this class will ignore the identity of the subclass and the added fields. Be sure this is what is intended, and that you don't need to override the equals method. Even if you don't need to override the equals method, consider overriding it anyway to document the fact that the equals method for the subclass just return the result of invoking super.equals(o).

#Eq: Unusual equals method (EQ_UNUSUAL)
EQ_UNUSUAL=;SFP--1;CWE-389
EQ_UNUSUALMsg=This class doesn't do any of the patterns we recognize for checking that the type of the argument is compatible with the type of the this object. There might not be anything wrong with this code, but it is worth reviewing.

#FE: Test for floating point equality (FE_FLOATING_POINT_EQUALITY)
FE_FLOATING_POINT_EQUALITY=;SFP--1;CWE-398
FE_FLOATING_POINT_EQUALITYMsg=This operation compares two floating point values for equality. Because floating point calculations may involve rounding, calculated float and double values may not be accurate. For values that must be precise, such as monetary values, consider using a fixed-precision type such as BigDecimal. For values that need not be precise, consider comparing for equality within some range, for example: if ( Math.abs(x - y) < .0000001 ). See the Java Language Specification, section 4.2.4.

#FS: Non-Boolean argument formatted using %b format specifier (VA_FORMAT_STRING_BAD_CONVERSION_TO_BOOLEAN)
VA_FORMAT_STRING_BAD_CONVERSION_TO_BOOLEAN=;SFP-1;CWE-686
VA_FORMAT_STRING_BAD_CONVERSION_TO_BOOLEANMsg=An argument not of type Boolean is being formatted with a %b format specifier. This won't throw an exception; instead, it will print true for any nonnull value, and false for null. This feature of format strings is strange, and may not be what you intended.

#IA: Potentially ambiguous invocation of either an inherited or outer method (IA_AMBIGUOUS_INVOCATION_OF_INHERITED_OR_OUTER_METHOD)
IA_AMBIGUOUS_INVOCATION_OF_INHERITED_OR_OUTER_METHOD=;SFP--1;CWE-398
IA_AMBIGUOUS_INVOCATION_OF_INHERITED_OR_OUTER_METHODMsg=An inner class is invoking a method that could be resolved to either a inherited method or a method defined in an outer class. By the Java semantics, it will be resolved to invoke the inherited method, but this may not be want you intend. If you really intend to invoke the inherited method, invoke it by invoking the method on super (e.g., invoke super.foo(17)), and thus it will be clear to other readers of your code and to FindBugs that you want to invoke the inherited method, not the method in the outer class.

#IC: Initialization circularity (IC_INIT_CIRCULARITY)
IC_INIT_CIRCULARITY=;SFP--1;CWE-398
IC_INIT_CIRCULARITYMsg=A circularity was detected in the static initializers of the two classes referenced by the bug instance.  Many kinds of unexpected behavior may arise from such circularity.

#ICAST: Integral division result cast to double or float (ICAST_IDIV_CAST_TO_DOUBLE)
ICAST_IDIV_CAST_TO_DOUBLE=;SFP-1;CWE-197
ICAST_IDIV_CAST_TO_DOUBLEMsg=This code casts the result of an integral division (e.g., int or long division) operation to double or float. Doing division on integers truncates the result to the integer value closest to zero. The fact that the result was cast to double suggests that this precision should have been retained. What was probably meant was to cast one or both of the operands to double before performing the division.

#ICAST: Result of integer multiplication cast to long (ICAST_INTEGER_MULTIPLY_CAST_TO_LONG)
ICAST_INTEGER_MULTIPLY_CAST_TO_LONG=;SFP-1;CWE-190
ICAST_INTEGER_MULTIPLY_CAST_TO_LONGMsg=This code performs integer multiply and then converts the result to a long, as in: long convertDaysToMilliseconds(int days) { return 1000*3600*24*days; } If the multiplication is done using long arithmetic, you can avoid the possibility that the result will overflow.

#IM: Computation of average could overflow (IM_AVERAGE_COMPUTATION_COULD_OVERFLOW)
IM_AVERAGE_COMPUTATION_COULD_OVERFLOW=;SFP-1;CWE-190
IM_AVERAGE_COMPUTATION_COULD_OVERFLOWMsg=The code computes the average of two integers using either division or signed right shift, and then uses the result as the index of an array. If the values being averaged are very large, this can overflow (resulting in the computation of a negative average). Assuming that the result is intended to be nonnegative, you can use an unsigned right shift instead. In other words, rather that using (low+high)/2, use (low+high) >>> 1. This bug exists in many earlier implementations of binary search and merge sort. Martin Buchholz found and fixed it in the JDK libraries, and Joshua Bloch widely publicized the bug pattern.

#IM: Check for oddness that won't work for negative numbers (IM_BAD_CHECK_FOR_ODD)
IM_BAD_CHECK_FOR_ODD=;SFP--1;CWE-398
IM_BAD_CHECK_FOR_ODDMsg=The code uses x % 2 == 1 to check to see if a value is odd, but this won't work for negative numbers (e.g., (-5) % 2 == -1). If this code is intending to check for oddness, consider using x & 1 == 1, or x % 2 != 0.

#INT: Integer remainder modulo 1 (INT_BAD_REM_BY_1)
INT_BAD_REM_BY_1=;SFP--1;CWE-398
INT_BAD_REM_BY_1Msg=Any expression (exp % 1) is guaranteed to always return zero. Did you mean (exp & 1) or (exp % 2) instead?

#INT: Vacuous bit mask operation on integer value (INT_VACUOUS_BIT_OPERATION)
INT_VACUOUS_BIT_OPERATION=;SFP-1;CWE-480
INT_VACUOUS_BIT_OPERATIONMsg=This is an integer bit operation (and, or, or exclusive or) that doesn't do any useful work (e.g., v & 0xffffffff).

#INT: Vacuous comparison of integer value (INT_VACUOUS_COMPARISON)
INT_VACUOUS_COMPARISON=;SFP--1;CWE-398
INT_VACUOUS_COMPARISONMsg=There is an integer comparison that always returns the same value (e.g., x <= Integer.MAX_VALUE).

#MTIA: Class extends Servlet class and uses instance variables (MTIA_SUSPECT_SERVLET_INSTANCE_FIELD)
MTIA_SUSPECT_SERVLET_INSTANCE_FIELD=;SFP--1;CWE-398
MTIA_SUSPECT_SERVLET_INSTANCE_FIELDMsg=This class extends from a Servlet class, and uses an instance member variable. Since only one instance of a Servlet class is created by the J2EE framework, and used in a multithreaded way, this paradigm is highly discouraged and most likely problematic. Consider only using method local variables.

#MTIA: Class extends Struts Action class and uses instance variables (MTIA_SUSPECT_STRUTS_INSTANCE_FIELD)
MTIA_SUSPECT_STRUTS_INSTANCE_FIELD=;SFP--1;CWE-398
MTIA_SUSPECT_STRUTS_INSTANCE_FIELDMsg=This class extends from a Struts Action class, and uses an instance member variable. Since only one instance of a struts Action class is created by the Struts framework, and used in a multithreaded way, this paradigm is highly discouraged and most likely problematic. Consider only using method local variables. Only instance fields that are written outside of a monitor are reported.

#NP: Dereference of the result of readLine() without nullcheck (NP_DEREFERENCE_OF_READLINE_VALUE)
NP_DEREFERENCE_OF_READLINE_VALUE=;SFP-7;CWE-476
NP_DEREFERENCE_OF_READLINE_VALUEMsg=The result of invoking readLine() is dereferenced without checking to see if the result is null. If there are no more lines of text to read, readLine() will return null and dereferencing that will generate a null pointer exception.

#NP: Immediate dereference of the result of readLine() (NP_IMMEDIATE_DEREFERENCE_OF_READLINE)
NP_IMMEDIATE_DEREFERENCE_OF_READLINE=;SFP-7;CWE-476
NP_IMMEDIATE_DEREFERENCE_OF_READLINEMsg=The result of invoking readLine() is immediately dereferenced. If there are no more lines of text to read, readLine() will return null and dereferencing that will generate a null pointer exception.

#NP: Load of known null value (NP_LOAD_OF_KNOWN_NULL_VALUE)
NP_LOAD_OF_KNOWN_NULL_VALUE=;SFP-7;CWE-476
NP_LOAD_OF_KNOWN_NULL_VALUEMsg=The variable referenced at this point is known to be null due to an earlier check against null. Although this is valid, it might be a mistake (perhaps you intended to refer to a different variable, or perhaps the earlier check to see if the variable is null should have been a check to see if it was nonnull).

#NP: Method tightens nullness annotation on parameter (NP_METHOD_PARAMETER_TIGHTENS_ANNOTATION)
NP_METHOD_PARAMETER_TIGHTENS_ANNOTATION=;SFP-7;CWE-476
NP_METHOD_PARAMETER_TIGHTENS_ANNOTATIONMsg=A method should always implement the contract of a method it overrides. Thus, if a method takes a parameter that is marked as @Nullable, you shouldn't override that method in a subclass with a method where that parameter is @Nonnull. Doing so violates the contract that the method should handle a null parameter.

#NP: Method relaxes nullness annotation on return value (NP_METHOD_RETURN_RELAXING_ANNOTATION)
NP_METHOD_RETURN_RELAXING_ANNOTATION=;SFP-7;CWE-476
NP_METHOD_RETURN_RELAXING_ANNOTATIONMsg=A method should always implement the contract of a method it overrides. Thus, if a method takes is annotated as returning a @Nonnull value, you shouldn't override that method in a subclass with a method annotated as returning a @Nullable or @CheckForNull value. Doing so violates the contract that the method shouldn't return null.

#NP: Possible null pointer dereference due to return value of called method (NP_NULL_ON_SOME_PATH_FROM_RETURN_VALUE)
NP_NULL_ON_SOME_PATH_FROM_RETURN_VALUE=;SFP-7;CWE-476
NP_NULL_ON_SOME_PATH_FROM_RETURN_VALUEMsg=The return value from a method is dereferenced without a null check, and the return value of that method is one that should generally be checked for null. This may lead to a NullPointerException when the code is executed.

#NP: Possible null pointer dereference on branch that might be infeasible (NP_NULL_ON_SOME_PATH_MIGHT_BE_INFEASIBLE)
NP_NULL_ON_SOME_PATH_MIGHT_BE_INFEASIBLE=;SFP-7;CWE-476
NP_NULL_ON_SOME_PATH_MIGHT_BE_INFEASIBLEMsg=There is a branch of statement that, if executed, guarantees that a null value will be dereferenced, which would generate a NullPointerException when the code is executed. Of course, the problem might be that the branch or statement is infeasible and that the null pointer exception can't ever be executed; deciding that is beyond the ability of FindBugs. Due to the fact that this value had been previously tested for nullness, this is a definite possibility.

#NP: Parameter must be non-null but is marked as nullable (NP_PARAMETER_MUST_BE_NONNULL_BUT_MARKED_AS_NULLABLE)
NP_PARAMETER_MUST_BE_NONNULL_BUT_MARKED_AS_NULLABLE=;SFP-7;CWE-476
NP_PARAMETER_MUST_BE_NONNULL_BUT_MARKED_AS_NULLABLEMsg=This parameter is always used in a way that requires it to be nonnull, but the parameter is explicitly annotated as being Nullable. Either the use of the parameter or the annotation is wrong.

#NP: Read of unwritten public or protected field (NP_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD)
NP_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD=;SFP-7;CWE-476
NP_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELDMsg=The program is dereferencing a public or protected field that does not seem to ever have a non-null value written to it. Unless the field is initialized via some mechanism not seen by the analysis, dereferencing this value will generate a null pointer exception.

#NS: Potentially dangerous use of non-short-circuit logic (NS_DANGEROUS_NON_SHORT_CIRCUIT)
NS_DANGEROUS_NON_SHORT_CIRCUIT=;SFP-1;CWE-768
NS_DANGEROUS_NON_SHORT_CIRCUITMsg=This code seems to be using non-short-circuit logic (e.g., & or |) rather than short-circuit logic (&& or ||). In addition, it seem possible that, depending on the value of the left hand side, you might not want to evaluate the right hand side (because it would have side effects, could cause an exception or could be expensive. Non-short-circuit logic causes both sides of the expression to be evaluated even when the result can be inferred from knowing the left-hand side. This can be less efficient and can result in errors if the left-hand side guards cases when evaluating the right-hand side can generate an error. See the Java Language Specification for details

#NS: Questionable use of non-short-circuit logic (NS_NON_SHORT_CIRCUIT)
NS_NON_SHORT_CIRCUIT=;SFP-1;CWE-768
NS_NON_SHORT_CIRCUITMsg=This code seems to be using non-short-circuit logic (e.g., & or |) rather than short-circuit logic (&& or ||). Non-short-circuit logic causes both sides of the expression to be evaluated even when the result can be inferred from knowing the left-hand side. This can be less efficient and can result in errors if the left-hand side guards cases when evaluating the right-hand side can generate an error. See the Java Language Specification for details

#PZLA: Consider returning a zero length array rather than null (PZLA_PREFER_ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAYS)
PZLA_PREFER_ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAYS=;SFP--1;CWE-710
PZLA_PREFER_ZERO_LENGTH_ARRAYSMsg=It is often a better design to return a length zero array rather than a null reference to indicate that there are no results (i.e., an empty list of results). This way, no explicit check for null is needed by clients of the method. On the other hand, using null to indicate "there is no answer to this question" is probably appropriate. For example, File.listFiles() returns an empty list if given a directory containing no files, and returns null if the file is not a directory.

#QF: Complicated, subtle or wrong increment in for-loop (QF_QUESTIONABLE_FOR_LOOP)
QF_QUESTIONABLE_FOR_LOOP=;SFP--1;CWE-389
QF_QUESTIONABLE_FOR_LOOPMsg=Are you sure this for loop is incrementing the correct variable? It appears that another variable is being initialized and checked by the for loop.

#RCN: Redundant comparison of non-null value to null (RCN_REDUNDANT_COMPARISON_OF_NULL_AND_NONNULL_VALUE)
RCN_REDUNDANT_COMPARISON_OF_NULL_AND_NONNULL_VALUE=;SFP--1;CWE-398
RCN_REDUNDANT_COMPARISON_OF_NULL_AND_NONNULL_VALUEMsg=This method contains a reference known to be non-null with another reference known to be null.

#RCN: Redundant comparison of two null values (RCN_REDUNDANT_COMPARISON_TWO_NULL_VALUES)
RCN_REDUNDANT_COMPARISON_TWO_NULL_VALUES=;SFP--1;CWE-398
RCN_REDUNDANT_COMPARISON_TWO_NULL_VALUESMsg=This method contains a redundant comparison of two references known to both be definitely null.

#RCN: Redundant nullcheck of value known to be non-null (RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_OF_NONNULL_VALUE)
RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_OF_NONNULL_VALUE=;SFP--1;CWE-398
RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_OF_NONNULL_VALUEMsg=This method contains a redundant check of a known non-null value against the constant null.

#RCN: Redundant nullcheck of value known to be null (RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_OF_NULL_VALUE)
RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_OF_NULL_VALUE=;SFP--1;CWE-398
RCN_REDUNDANT_NULLCHECK_OF_NULL_VALUEMsg=This method contains a redundant check of a known null value against the constant null.

#REC: Exception is caught when Exception is not thrown (REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION)
REC_CATCH_EXCEPTION=;SFP-5;CWE-396
REC_CATCH_EXCEPTIONMsg=This method uses a try-catch block that catches Exception objects, but Exception is not thrown within the try block, and RuntimeException is not explicitly caught. It is a common bug pattern to say try { ... } catch (Exception e) { something } as a shorthand for catching a number of types of exception each of whose catch blocks is identical, but this construct also accidentally catches RuntimeException as well, masking potential bugs.

#RI: Class implements same interface as superclass (RI_REDUNDANT_INTERFACES)
RI_REDUNDANT_INTERFACES=;SFP--1;CWE-398
RI_REDUNDANT_INTERFACESMsg=This class declares that it implements an interface that is also implemented by a superclass. This is redundant because once a superclass implements an interface, all subclasses by default also implement this interface. It may point out that the inheritance hierarchy has changed since this class was created, and consideration should be given to the ownership of the interface's implementation.

#RV: Method checks to see if result of String.indexOf is positive (RV_CHECK_FOR_POSITIVE_INDEXOF)
RV_CHECK_FOR_POSITIVE_INDEXOF=;SFP--1;CWE-398
RV_CHECK_FOR_POSITIVE_INDEXOFMsg=The method invokes String.indexOf and checks to see if the result is positive or non-positive. It is much more typical to check to see if the result is negative or non-negative. It is positive only if the substring checked for occurs at some place other than at the beginning of the String.

#RV: Method discards result of readLine after checking if it is non-null (RV_DONT_JUST_NULL_CHECK_READLINE)
RV_DONT_JUST_NULL_CHECK_READLINE=;SFP-4;CWE-253
RV_DONT_JUST_NULL_CHECK_READLINEMsg=The value returned by readLine is discarded after checking to see if the return value is non-null. In almost all situations, if the result is non-null, you will want to use that non-null value. Calling readLine again will give you a different line.

#RV: Remainder of hashCode could be negative (RV_REM_OF_HASHCODE)
RV_REM_OF_HASHCODE=;SFP--1;CWE-398
RV_REM_OF_HASHCODEMsg=This code computes a hashCode, and then computes the remainder of that value modulo another value. Since the hashCode can be negative, the result of the remainder operation can also be negative. Assuming you want to ensure that the result of your computation is nonnegative, you may need to change your code. If you know the divisor is a power of 2, you can use a bitwise and operator instead (i.e., instead of using x.hashCode()%n, use x.hashCode()&(n-1). This is probably faster than computing the remainder as well. If you don't know that the divisor is a power of 2, take the absolute value of the result of the remainder operation (i.e., use Math.abs(x.hashCode()%n)

#RV: Remainder of 32-bit signed random integer (RV_REM_OF_RANDOM_INT)
RV_REM_OF_RANDOM_INT=;SFP--1;CWE-398
RV_REM_OF_RANDOM_INTMsg=This code generates a random signed integer and then computes the remainder of that value modulo another value. Since the random number can be negative, the result of the remainder operation can also be negative. Be sure this is intended, and strongly consider using the Random.nextInt(int) method instead.

#RV: Method ignores return value, is this OK? (RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_INFERRED)
RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_INFERRED=;SFP-4;CWE-253
RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_INFERREDMsg=This code calls a method and ignores the return value. The return value is the same type as the type the method is invoked on, and from our analysis it looks like the return value might be important (e.g., like ignoring the return value of String.toLowerCase()).

#RV: Return value of method without side effect is ignored (RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_NO_SIDE_EFFECT)
RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_NO_SIDE_EFFECT=;SFP-4;CWE-253
RV_RETURN_VALUE_IGNORED_NO_SIDE_EFFECTMsg=This code calls a method and ignores the return value. However our analysis shows that the method (including its implementations in subclasses if any) does not produce any effect other than return value. Thus this call can be removed.

#SA: Double assignment of field (SA_FIELD_DOUBLE_ASSIGNMENT)
SA_FIELD_DOUBLE_ASSIGNMENT=;SFP--1;CWE-398
SA_FIELD_DOUBLE_ASSIGNMENTMsg=This method contains a double assignment of a field

#SA: Double assignment of local variable (SA_LOCAL_DOUBLE_ASSIGNMENT)
SA_LOCAL_DOUBLE_ASSIGNMENT=;SFP--1;CWE-398
SA_LOCAL_DOUBLE_ASSIGNMENTMsg=This method contains a double assignment of a local variable

#SA: Self assignment of local variable (SA_LOCAL_SELF_ASSIGNMENT)
SA_LOCAL_SELF_ASSIGNMENT=;SFP--1;CWE-398
SA_LOCAL_SELF_ASSIGNMENTMsg=This method contains a self assignment of a local variable

#SF: Switch statement found where one case falls through to the next case (SF_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGH)
SF_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGH=;SFP-4;CWE-484
SF_SWITCH_FALLTHROUGHMsg=This method contains a switch statement where one case branch will fall through to the next case. Usually you need to end this case with a break or return.

#SF: Switch statement found where default case is missing (SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULT)
SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULT=;SFP-4;CWE-478
SF_SWITCH_NO_DEFAULTMsg=This method contains a switch statement where default case is missing. Usually you need to provide a default case.

#ST: Write to static field from instance method (ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD)
ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHOD=;SFP--1;CWE-398
ST_WRITE_TO_STATIC_FROM_INSTANCE_METHODMsg=This instance method writes to a static field. This is tricky to get correct if multiple instances are being manipulated, and generally bad practice.

#Se: Private readResolve method not inherited by subclasses (SE_PRIVATE_READ_RESOLVE_NOT_INHERITED)
SE_PRIVATE_READ_RESOLVE_NOT_INHERITED=;SFP--1;CWE-398
SE_PRIVATE_READ_RESOLVE_NOT_INHERITEDMsg=This class defines a private readResolve method. Since it is private, it won't be inherited by subclasses. This might be intentional and OK, but should be reviewed to ensure it is what is intended.

#Se: Transient field of class that isn't Serializable. (SE_TRANSIENT_FIELD_OF_NONSERIALIZABLE_CLASS)
SE_TRANSIENT_FIELD_OF_NONSERIALIZABLE_CLASS=;SFP--1;CWE-398
SE_TRANSIENT_FIELD_OF_NONSERIALIZABLE_CLASSMsg=The field is marked as transient, but the class isn't Serializable, so marking it as transient has absolutely no effect. This may be leftover marking from a previous version of the code in which the class was transient, or it may indicate a misunderstanding of how serialization works.

#TQ: Value required to have type qualifier, but marked as unknown (TQ_EXPLICIT_UNKNOWN_SOURCE_VALUE_REACHES_ALWAYS_SINK)
TQ_EXPLICIT_UNKNOWN_SOURCE_VALUE_REACHES_ALWAYS_SINK=;SFP--1;CWE-398
TQ_EXPLICIT_UNKNOWN_SOURCE_VALUE_REACHES_ALWAYS_SINKMsg=A value is used in a way that requires it to be always be a value denoted by a type qualifier, but there is an explicit annotation stating that it is not known where the value is required to have that type qualifier. Either the usage or the annotation is incorrect.

#TQ: Value required to not have type qualifier, but marked as unknown (TQ_EXPLICIT_UNKNOWN_SOURCE_VALUE_REACHES_NEVER_SINK)
TQ_EXPLICIT_UNKNOWN_SOURCE_VALUE_REACHES_NEVER_SINK=;SFP--1;CWE-398
TQ_EXPLICIT_UNKNOWN_SOURCE_VALUE_REACHES_NEVER_SINKMsg=A value is used in a way that requires it to be never be a value denoted by a type qualifier, but there is an explicit annotation stating that it is not known where the value is prohibited from having that type qualifier. Either the usage or the annotation is incorrect.

#UC: Condition has no effect (UC_USELESS_CONDITION)
UC_USELESS_CONDITION=;SFP--1;CWE-398
UC_USELESS_CONDITIONMsg=This condition always produces the same result as the value of the involved variable was narrowed before. Probably something else was meant or condition can be removed.

#UC: Condition has no effect due to the variable type (UC_USELESS_CONDITION_TYPE)
UC_USELESS_CONDITION_TYPE=;SFP--1;CWE-398
UC_USELESS_CONDITION_TYPEMsg=This condition always produces the same result due to the type range of the involved variable. Probably something else was meant or condition can be removed.

#UC: Useless object created (UC_USELESS_OBJECT)
UC_USELESS_OBJECT=;SFP--1;CWE-398
UC_USELESS_OBJECTMsg=Our analysis shows that this object is useless. It's created and modified, but its value never go outside of the method or produce any side-effect. Either there is a mistake and object was intended to be used or it can be removed.

#UC: Useless object created on stack (UC_USELESS_OBJECT_STACK)
UC_USELESS_OBJECT_STACK=;SFP--1;CWE-398
UC_USELESS_OBJECT_STACKMsg=This object is created just to perform some modifications which don't have any side-effect. Probably something else was meant or the object can be removed.

#UC: Useless non-empty void method (UC_USELESS_VOID_METHOD)
UC_USELESS_VOID_METHOD=;SFP--1;CWE-398
UC_USELESS_VOID_METHODMsg=Our analysis shows that this non-empty void method does not actually perform any useful work. Please check it: probably there's a mistake in its code or its body can be fully removed.

#UCF: Useless control flow (UCF_USELESS_CONTROL_FLOW)
UCF_USELESS_CONTROL_FLOW=;SFP--1;CWE-398
UCF_USELESS_CONTROL_FLOWMsg=This method contains a useless control flow statement, where control flow continues onto the same place regardless of whether or not the branch is taken.

#UCF: Useless control flow to next line (UCF_USELESS_CONTROL_FLOW_NEXT_LINE)
UCF_USELESS_CONTROL_FLOW_NEXT_LINE=;SFP--1;CWE-398
UCF_USELESS_CONTROL_FLOW_NEXT_LINEMsg=This method contains a useless control flow statement in which control flow follows to the same or following line regardless of whether or not the branch is taken. Often, this is caused by inadvertently using an empty statement as the body of an if statement

#UrF: Unread public/protected field (URF_UNREAD_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD)
URF_UNREAD_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD=;SFP--1;CWE-398
URF_UNREAD_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELDMsg=This field is never read.  The field is public or protected, so perhaps it is intended to be used with classes not seen as part of the analysis. If not, consider removing it from the class.

#UuF: Unused public or protected field (UUF_UNUSED_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD)
UUF_UNUSED_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD=;SFP--1;CWE-398
UUF_UNUSED_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELDMsg=This field is never used.  The field is public or protected, so perhaps it is intended to be used with classes not seen as part of the analysis. If not, consider removing it from the class.

#UwF: Field not initialized in constructor but dereferenced without null check (UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR)
UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTOR=;SFP-1;CWE-456
UWF_FIELD_NOT_INITIALIZED_IN_CONSTRUCTORMsg=This field is never initialized within any constructor, and is therefore could be null after the object is constructed. This could be a either an error or a questionable design, since it means a null pointer exception will be generated if that field is dereferenced before being initialized.

#UwF: Unwritten public or protected field (UWF_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD)
UWF_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELD=;SFP-1;CWE-456
UWF_UNWRITTEN_PUBLIC_OR_PROTECTED_FIELDMsg=No writes were seen to this public/protected field.  All reads of it will return the default value. Check for errors (should it have been initialized?), or remove it if it is useless.

#XFB: Method directly allocates a specific implementation of xml interfaces (XFB_XML_FACTORY_BYPASS)
XFB_XML_FACTORY_BYPASS=;SFP--1;CWE-398
XFB_XML_FACTORY_BYPASSMsg=This method allocates a specific implementation of an xml interface. It is preferable to use the supplied factory classes to create these objects so that the implementation can be changed at runtime.
